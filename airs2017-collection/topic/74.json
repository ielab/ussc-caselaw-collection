FLORIDA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT \n\n      COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA, FIFTH DISTRICT\n\n              No. 16–6250. Decided March 6, 2017\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n  Robert Perez is serving more than 15 years in a Florida\nprison for what may have been nothing more than a\ndrunken joke. The road to this unfortunate outcome\nbegan with Perez and his friends drinking a mixture of\nvodka and grapefruit juice at the beach. Sentencing Tr.\n24, App. to Pet. for Cert. (Sentencing Tr.). As the group\napproached a nearby liquor store to purchase additional\ningredients for the mixture, which Perez called a “Molly\ncocktail,” ibid., a store employee overheard the group’s\nconversation, id., at 25. The employee apparently believed\nhe was referencing an incendiary “Molotov cocktail” and\nasked if it would “burn anything up.” Ibid. Perez claims\nhe responded that he did not have “that type” of cocktail,\nand that the whole group laughed at the apparent joke.\nIbid. Imprudently, however, the inebriated Perez contin-\nued the banter, telling another employee that he had only\n“one Molotov cocktail” and could “blow the whole place\nup.” App. C to Brief in Opposition 82. Perez later re-\nturned to the store and allegedly said, “ ‘I’m going to blow\nup this whole [expletive] world.’ ” Id., at 121. Store em-\nployees reported the incident to police the next day. Sen-\ntencing Tr. 15, 34.\n  The State prosecuted Perez for violating a Florida stat-\nute that makes it a felony “to threaten to throw, project,\nplace, or discharge any destructive device with intent to do\nbodily harm to any person or with intent to do damage to\nany property of any person.” Fla. Stat. §790.162 (2007).\n\u000c2                     PEREZ v. FLORIDA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nThe trial court instructed the jury that they could return a\nguilty verdict if the State proved two elements. First, the\nState had to prove the actus reus; that is, the threat itself.\nThe instruction defined a threat as “a communicated\nintent to inflict harm or loss on another when viewed\nand/or heard by an ordinary reasonable person.” App. F to\nBrief in Opposition 350. Second, the State had to prove\nthat Perez possessed the necessary mens rea; that is, that\nhe intended to make the threat. Circularly, the instruc-\ntion defined intent as “the stated intent to do bodily harm\nto any person or damage to the property of any person.”\nIbid. This instruction permitted the jury to convict Perez\nbased on what he “stated” alone—irrespective of whether\nhis words represented a joke, the ramblings of an intoxi-\ncated individual, or a credible threat. The jury found\nPerez guilty, and because he qualified as a habitual of-\nfender, the trial court sentenced him to 15 years and 1 day\nin prison. Sentencing Tr. 44.\n   In the courts below and in his petition for certiorari,\nPerez challenged the instruction primarily on the ground\nthat it contravenes the traditional rule that criminal\nstatutes be interpreted to require proof of mens rea, see\nElonis v. United States, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e575\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e___, ___–___ (2015) (slip\nop., at 9–13). In my view, however, the jury instruction—\nand Perez’s conviction—raise serious First Amendment\nconcerns worthy of this Court’s review.

Under our cases,\nthis distinction turns in part on the speaker’s intent.\n   We suggested as much in Watts. There, we faced a\nconstitutional challenge to a criminal threat statute and\nexpressed “grave doubts” that the First Amendment per-\nmitted a criminal conviction if the speaker merely “uttered\nthe charged words with an apparent determination to\ncarry them into execution.” Id., at 708, 707 (emphasis and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n   Virginia v.

There, we considered a state\nstatute that criminalized cross burning “ ‘with the intent of\nintimidating any person.’ ” Id., at 348 (quoting Va. Code.\nAnn. §18.2–423 (1996)). We defined a “true threat” as one\n“where the speaker means to communicate a serious ex-\npression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence\nto a particular individual or group of individuals.” 538\nU. S., at 359. We recognized that cross burning is not\nalways such an expression and held the statute constitu-\ntional “insofar as it ban[ned] cross burning with intent to\nintimidate.” Id., at 362 (emphasis added); id., at 365\n(plurality opinion).\n   A four-Member plurality went further and found uncon-\nstitutional a provision of the statute that declared the\nspeech itself “ ‘prima facie evidence of an intent to intimi-\ndate.’ ” Id., at 363–364. The plurality reached this conclu-\nsion because “a burning cross is not always intended to\nintimidate.” Id., at 365. Two separate opinions endorsed\nthis view. See id., at 372 (Scalia, J., joined by THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and\ndissenting in part) (“The plurality is correct in all of this”);\nid., at 386 (Souter, J., joined by KENNEDY and GINSBURG,\nJJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart).\n\u000c4                     PEREZ v. FLORIDA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n  Together, Watts and Black make clear that to sustain a\nthreat conviction without encroaching upon the First\nAmendment, States must prove more than the mere ut-\nterance of threatening words—some level of intent is\nrequired. And these two cases strongly suggest that it is\nnot enough that a reasonable person might have under-\nstood the words as a threat—a jury must find that the\nspeaker actually intended to convey a threat.\n                         *    *     *\n   The jury instruction in this case relieved the State of its\nburden of proving anything other than Perez’s “stated” or\n“communicated” intent. This replicates the view we\ndoubted in Watts, which permitted a criminal conviction\nbased upon threatening words and only “ ‘an apparent\ndetermination to carry them into execution.’ ” 394 U. S., at\n707. And like the prima facie provision in Black, the trial\ncourt’s jury instruction “ignore[d] all of the contextual\nfactors that are necessary to decide whether a particular\n[expression] is intended to intimidate.” 538 U. S., at 367\n(plurality opinion).\n   Context in this case might have made a difference.\nEven as she argued for a 15-year sentence, the prosecutor\nacknowledged that Perez may have been “just a harmless\ndrunk guy at the beach,” Sentencing Tr. 35, and it appears\nthat at least one witness testified that she did not find\nPerez threatening, Pet. for Cert. 8. Instead of being in-\nstructed to weigh this evidence to determine whether\nPerez actually intended to convey a threat—or even\nwhether a reasonable person would have construed Perez’s\nwords as a threat—the jury was directed to convict solely\non the basis of what Perez “stated.”\n   In an appropriate case, the Court should affirm that\n“[t]he First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut.”\nBlack, 538 U.
