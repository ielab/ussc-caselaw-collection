The District Court entered\n  an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to a term of imprisonment.\n  It also acknowledged that restitution was mandatory but deferred de-\n  termination of the restitution amount. Petitioner filed a notice of ap-\n  peal from this initial judgment. Months later, the District Court en-\n  tered an amended judgment, ordering petitioner to pay restitution to\n  one of his victims. Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal\n  from the amended judgment. When he nonetheless challenged the\n  restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government ar-\n  gued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second\n  notice of appeal. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, holding that petitioner\n  could not challenge the restitution amount.\nHeld: A defendant wishing to appeal an order imposing restitution in a\n deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.\n If he fails to do so and the Government objects, he may not challenge\n the restitution order on appeal.

Because the Government timely raised the\n    issue, “the court’s duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.” Id., at\n    18. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) Petitioner’s argument that his single notice of appeal sufficed\n    under the Federal Rules to appeal both judgments depends on two\n    premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one\n    “judgment,” as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and sec-\n    ond, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it\n    “springs forward” under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judg-\n    ment imposing restitution. Each premise is rejected. Pp. 5–7.\n          (1) This Court’s analysis in Dolan v. United States, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/148484/dolan-v-united-states/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e560\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e605\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e,\n    makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable\n    judgments, not one. The Dolan Court did not decide the question\n    presented here, but the Court was not persuaded by the argument\n    that “a sentencing judgment is not ‘final’ until it contains a definitive\n    determination of the amount of restitution.” Id., at 617–618. In-\n    stead, the Court recognized, “strong arguments” supported the propo-\n    sition that both the initial judgment and the restitution order were\n    each immediately appealable final judgments. Ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n          (2) Because petitioner’s notice of appeal was filed well before the\n    District Court announced the sentence imposing restitution, the no-\n    tice of appeal did not “spring forward” to become effective on the date\n    the court entered its amended restitution judgment. By its own\n    terms, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sen-\n    tence has been announced and before the judgment imposing the sen-\n    tence is entered on the docket. Even if the District Court’s acknowl-\n    edgment in the initial judgment that restitution was mandatory\n    could qualify as a “sentence” that the District Court “announced” un-\n    der Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is\n    mandatory for his offense. Rather, he argued on appeal that the\n    amount imposed is unlawful. Pp. 6–7.\n       (c) Petitioner’s alternative argument that any defect in his notice of\n    appeal should be overlooked as harmless error is rejected.

First, the\n    Lemke petitioner’s notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule\n    4(b)(2).

But the amount\nto be imposed is not always known at the time of sentenc-\ning. When that is the case, the court may enter an initial\njudgment imposing certain aspects of a defendant’s sen-\ntence, such as a term of imprisonment, while deferring a\ndetermination of the amount of restitution until entry of a\nlater, amended judgment.\n  We must decide whether a single notice of appeal, filed\nbetween the initial judgment and the amended judgment,\nis sufficient to invoke appellate review of the later-\ndetermined restitution amount. We hold that it is not, at\nleast where, as here, the Government objects to the de-\nfendant’s failure to file a notice of appeal following the\namended judgment.\n                            I\n  After federal agents found more than 300 files contain-\ning child pornography on his computer, petitioner Marcelo\nManrique pleaded guilty to possessing a visual depiction\nof a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, in viola-\n\u000c2              MANRIQUE v.

Under the\nMandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the\nDistrict Court was required to order petitioner to “make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense.” §3663A(a)(1); see\n§§2259(a), (b)(2) (“An order of restitution under this sec-\ntion shall be issued and enforced in accordance with\n[§]3664 in the same manner as an order under [§]3663A”).\n   On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial\njudgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprison-\nment and a life term of supervised release. At the sen-\ntencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution\nwas mandatory. But, consistent with the MVRA, the court\npostponed determining the victims’ damages, which had\nnot yet been ascertained. See, e.g., §3664(d)(5); Dolan v.\nUnited States, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/148484/dolan-v-united-states/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e560\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e605\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 607–608 (2010).

Only one of the victims sought restitu-\ntion. The court ordered petitioner to pay $4,500 in restitu-\ntion to her and entered an amended judgment the next\nday imposing that sentence. Petitioner did not file a\nsecond notice of appeal from the court’s order imposing\nrestitution or from the amended judgment.\n   Notwithstanding his failure to file a second notice of\nappeal, petitioner challenged the restitution amount\nbefore the Eleventh Circuit, arguing in his brief that the\nGovernment had not shown he was the proximate cause of\nthe victim’s injuries and that the restitution amount bore\nno rational relationship to the damages she claimed. The\nGovernment countered that petitioner had forfeited his\nright to challenge the restitution amount by failing to file\n\u000c                  Cite as: 581 U.

Section\n3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal\nof a sentence that “was imposed in violation of law.”\n(Emphasis added.) And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides gener-\nally that, “[i]n a criminal case, a defendant’s notice of\nappeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days\nafter . . . the entry of either the judgment or the order\nbeing appealed.” (Emphasis added.)\n  Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded\nby many months the sentence and judgment imposing\nrestitution.

He thus\nfailed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules\nthe amended judgment imposing restitution.\n   The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional\nprerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution\namount. See, e.g., Brief for United States 28–31. This\nposition follows, according to the Government, from many\nof our cases emphasizing the “jurisdictional significance”\nof a notice of appeal. E.g., Griggs v.

Be-\ncause the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the Govern-\nment explains, the Court of Appeals was required to dis-\nmiss petitioner’s appeal regardless of whether the\nGovernment raised the issue.\n   We do not need to decide in this case whether the Gov-\nernment is correct. The requirement that a defendant file\na timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment\nimposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-\nprocessing rule. See Greenlaw v.

See Brief for\nUnited States in No. 14–13029 (CA11), pp. 22–25 (arguing\nthat petitioner “waived his right to appeal the district\ncourt’s order of restitution by failing to file a notice of\nappeal from that order” (capitalization omitted)). Accord-\ningly, “the court’s duty to dismiss the appeal was manda-\ntory.” Eberhart, supra, at 18.\n                              B\n  Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his\nsingle notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal\nboth the initial judgment and the amended judgment\nimposing restitution. As we understand it, his argument\ndepends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution\ncase, there is only one “judgment,” as that term is used in\nRules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of\nappeal is filed after the initial judgment, it “springs for-\nward” under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment\nimposing restitution.

See id., at 616. Although we did not decide\n“whether or when a party can, or must, appeal”—the\nquestion presented here—we were not persuaded by the\nargument that “a sentencing judgment is not ‘final’ until it\ncontains a definitive determination of the amount of resti-\ntution.” Id., at 617–618. To the contrary, we recognized\n“strong arguments” supporting the proposition that both\nthe “initial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of impris-\nonment and supervised release” and the subsequent “ ‘sen-\ntence that impose[d] an order of restitution’ ” were each\nimmediately appealable final judgments. Ibid.

See Rule 4(b)(6) (“A judgment or\norder is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is\nentered on the criminal docket”). If the court has not yet\ndecided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then\nthe Rule does not come into play. Accordingly, it does not\napply where a district court enters an initial judgment\ndeferring restitution and subsequently amends the judg-\nment to include the sentence of restitution. By deferring\nrestitution, the court is declining to announce a sentence.\n   When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case,\nthe District Court had observed only that restitution was\n“mandatory.” App. 27. The court did not announce the\nrestitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue)\nuntil months later. Even if describing restitution as man-\ndatory could qualify as a “sentence” that the District Court\n“announced” under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never\ndisputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.\nRather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the resti-\ntution imposed—an issue the court did not consider until\nmonths later—is unlawful. Because petitioner’s notice of\nappeal was filed well before the District Court announced\nthe sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of\nappeal did not “spring forward” to become effective on the\ndate the court entered its amended judgment imposing\nthat sentence.\n\u000c8               MANRIQUE v.

In that case, the petitioner filed a\nnotice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced\nbut three days before the judgment was entered. Id., at\n326. His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature\nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which\nthen governed notices of appeal in criminal cases. This\nCourt reversed on the ground that the premature filing\nwas harmless error under Rule 52(a). Ibid.\n   The Court’s holding in Lemke does not apply to petitioner’s\nfailure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judg-\nment. Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure in two ways. First, the Lemke peti-\ntioner’s notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule\n4(b)(2). As discussed in Part II–B–2, supra, petitioner\nhere cannot take advantage of that rule. Second, Rule\n3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors\nassociated with filing a notice of appeal. The court of\nappeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice\nof appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice. It\nmay not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at\nall. The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended\njudgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory\nclaim-processing rule, Part II–A, supra, meaning that the\nrequirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as\nthe opposing party raises the issue. By definition, manda-\ntory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture,\nare not subject to harmless-error analysis.\n   Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of\nappeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution,\nbut rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from\nthe amended judgment.

Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:\n    “Appealing a Sentence. After sentencing—regardless\n    of the defendant’s plea—the court must advise the de-\n    fendant of any right to appeal the sentence.”\nThe District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice\nupon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014,\nsee App. 29; that court gave no such advice upon amend-\ning its judgment on September 18, 2014 to include the\namount of restitution ordered, see id., at 10, 46–65. The\nGovernment agrees that the District Court was “absolutely”\nrequired to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the\nrestitution order, and anticipates that the required advice\n“will prevent cases like this from arising again in the\nfuture.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.\n  Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to\nappeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that\nno second notice was required to place the restitution\namount before the Court of Appeals. Without awaiting\nanother appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted\nthe amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the\nCourt of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket\nof the appeal from the conviction and sentence already\npending in that court. App. 10. In turn, the Eleventh\nCircuit’s clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up\nthe transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing.\nSee Docket in No. 14–13029 (CA11).\n  In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the\nclerk’s dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of\nAppeals “confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals.”\nGriggs v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 15–7250. Argued October 11, 2016—Decided April 19, 2017\nAfter federal agents found child pornography on petitioner’s computer,\n  he pleaded guilty to possessing a visual depiction of a minor engaging\n  in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §§2252(a)(4)(B)\n  and (b)(2), an offense requiring a district court to “make restitution to\n  the victim of the offense,” §3663A(a)(1). The District Court entered\n  an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to a term of imprisonment.\n  It also acknowledged that restitution was mandatory but deferred de-\n  termination of the restitution amount. Petitioner filed a notice of ap-\n  peal from this initial judgment. Months later, the District Court en-\n  tered an amended judgment, ordering petitioner to pay restitution to\n  one of his victims. Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal\n  from the amended judgment. When he nonetheless challenged the\n  restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government ar-\n  gued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second\n  notice of appeal. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, holding that petitioner\n  could not challenge the restitution amount.\nHeld: A defendant wishing to appeal an order imposing restitution in a\n deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.\n If he fails to do so and the Government objects, he may not challenge\n the restitution order on appeal. Pp. 3–9.\n    (a) Both 18 U. S. C. §3742(a), which governs criminal appeals, and\n Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) contemplate that a de-\n fendant will file a notice of appeal after the district court has decided\n the issue sought to be appealed. Here, petitioner filed only one notice\n of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judg-\n ment imposing restitution. He therefore failed to properly appeal the\n amended judgment. Whether or not the requirement that a defend-\n ant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment impos-\n\u000c2                    MANRIQUE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite, it is at least a manda-\n    tory claim-processing rule, which is “unalterable” if raised properly\n    by the party asserting a violation of the rule. Eberhart v. United\n    States, 546 U. S. 12, 15. Because the Government timely raised the\n    issue, “the court’s duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.” Id., at\n    18. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) Petitioner’s argument that his single notice of appeal sufficed\n    under the Federal Rules to appeal both judgments depends on two\n    premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one\n    “judgment,” as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and sec-\n    ond, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it\n    “springs forward” under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judg-\n    ment imposing restitution. Each premise is rejected. Pp. 5–7.\n          (1) This Court’s analysis in Dolan v. United States, 560 U. S. 605,\n    makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable\n    judgments, not one. The Dolan Court did not decide the question\n    presented here, but the Court was not persuaded by the argument\n    that “a sentencing judgment is not ‘final’ until it contains a definitive\n    determination of the amount of restitution.” Id., at 617–618. In-\n    stead, the Court recognized, “strong arguments” supported the propo-\n    sition that both the initial judgment and the restitution order were\n    each immediately appealable final judgments. Ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n          (2) Because petitioner’s notice of appeal was filed well before the\n    District Court announced the sentence imposing restitution, the no-\n    tice of appeal did not “spring forward” to become effective on the date\n    the court entered its amended restitution judgment. By its own\n    terms, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sen-\n    tence has been announced and before the judgment imposing the sen-\n    tence is entered on the docket. Even if the District Court’s acknowl-\n    edgment in the initial judgment that restitution was mandatory\n    could qualify as a “sentence” that the District Court “announced” un-\n    der Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is\n    mandatory for his offense. Rather, he argued on appeal that the\n    amount imposed is unlawful.

But the amount\nto be imposed is not always known at the time of sentenc-\ning. When that is the case, the court may enter an initial\njudgment imposing certain aspects of a defendant’s sen-\ntence, such as a term of imprisonment, while deferring a\ndetermination of the amount of restitution until entry of a\nlater, amended judgment.\n  We must decide whether a single notice of appeal, filed\nbetween the initial judgment and the amended judgment,\nis sufficient to invoke appellate review of the later-\ndetermined restitution amount. We hold that it is not, at\nleast where, as here, the Government objects to the de-\nfendant’s failure to file a notice of appeal following the\namended judgment.\n                            I\n  After federal agents found more than 300 files contain-\ning child pornography on his computer, petitioner Marcelo\nManrique pleaded guilty to possessing a visual depiction\nof a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, in viola-\n\u000c2              MANRIQUE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of 18 U. S. C. §§2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2). Under the\nMandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the\nDistrict Court was required to order petitioner to “make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense.” §3663A(a)(1); see\n§§2259(a), (b)(2) (“An order of restitution under this sec-\ntion shall be issued and enforced in accordance with\n[§]3664 in the same manner as an order under [§]3663A”).\n   On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial\njudgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprison-\nment and a life term of supervised release. At the sen-\ntencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution\nwas mandatory. But, consistent with the MVRA, the court\npostponed determining the victims’ damages, which had\nnot yet been ascertained. See, e.g., §3664(d)(5); Dolan v.\nUnited States, 560 U. S. 605, 607–608 (2010). Accordingly,\nthe judgment expressly deferred “determination of restitu-\ntion” and noted that an “Amended Judgment . . . w[ould]\nbe entered after such determination.” App. 39. On July 8,\npetitioner filed a notice of appeal “from the final judgment\nand sentence entered in this action on the 24th day of\nJune, 2014.” Id., at 42.\n   The District Court held a restitution hearing on Sep-\ntember 17, 2014. Only one of the victims sought restitu-\ntion. The court ordered petitioner to pay $4,500 in restitu-\ntion to her and entered an amended judgment the next\nday imposing that sentence. Petitioner did not file a\nsecond notice of appeal from the court’s order imposing\nrestitution or from the amended judgment.\n   Notwithstanding his failure to file a second notice of\nappeal, petitioner challenged the restitution amount\nbefore the Eleventh Circuit, arguing in his brief that the\nGovernment had not shown he was the proximate cause of\nthe victim’s injuries and that the restitution amount bore\nno rational relationship to the damages she claimed. The\nGovernment countered that petitioner had forfeited his\nright to challenge the restitution amount by failing to file\n\u000c                  Cite as: 581 U.

Appx. 579, 583–584 (CA11 2015)\n( per curiam). We granted certiorari, 578 U. S. ___ (2016),\nand now affirm.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  To secure appellate review of a judgment or order, a\nparty must file a notice of appeal from that judgment or\norder. Filing a notice of appeal transfers adjudicatory\nauthority from the district court to the court of appeals.\nThe statute that governs appeals of criminal sentences, 18\nU. S. C. §3742(a), provides that a “defendant may file a\nnotice of appeal in the district court for review of an oth-\nerwise final sentence” in certain specified circumstances.\nSee United States v. Ruiz, 536 U. S. 622, 626−628 (2002).\nAnd Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) specifies\nthat “[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right . . . may be\ntaken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district\nclerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n  Both §3742(a) and Rule 4 contemplate that the defend-\nant will file the notice of appeal after the district court has\ndecided the issue sought to be appealed.                Section\n3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal\nof a sentence that “was imposed in violation of law.”\n(Emphasis added.) And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides gener-\nally that, “[i]n a criminal case, a defendant’s notice of\nappeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days\nafter . . . the entry of either the judgment or the order\nbeing appealed.” (Emphasis added.)\n  Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded\nby many months the sentence and judgment imposing\nrestitution. His notice of appeal could not have been “for\n\u000c4              MANRIQUE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview” of the restitution order, §3742(a), and it was not\nfiled within the timeframe allowed by Rule 4. He thus\nfailed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules\nthe amended judgment imposing restitution.\n   The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional\nprerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution\namount. See, e.g., Brief for United States 28–31. This\nposition follows, according to the Government, from many\nof our cases emphasizing the “jurisdictional significance”\nof a notice of appeal. E.g., Griggs v. Provident Consumer\nDiscount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) ( per curiam). Be-\ncause the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the Govern-\nment explains, the Court of Appeals was required to dis-\nmiss petitioner’s appeal regardless of whether the\nGovernment raised the issue.\n   We do not need to decide in this case whether the Gov-\nernment is correct. The requirement that a defendant file\na timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment\nimposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-\nprocessing rule. See Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.\n237, 252–253 (2008); see also Rule 3(a)(2) (“An appellant’s\nfailure to take any step other than the timely filing of a\nnotice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal,\nbut is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it\nconsiders appropriate, including dismissing the appeal”\n(emphasis added)). Mandatory claim-processing rules\n“seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by\nrequiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at\ncertain specified times.” Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S.\n428, 435 (2011). Unlike jurisdictional rules, mandatory\nclaim-processing rules may be forfeited “if the party as-\nserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.” Eber-\nhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12, 15 (2005) ( per curiam)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). If a party “properly\nraise[s] them,” however, they are “unalterable.” Id., at 15,\n\u000c                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n19.\n  The Government timely raised petitioner’s failure to file\na notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing\nrestitution before the Court of Appeals. See Brief for\nUnited States in No. 14–13029 (CA11), pp. 22–25 (arguing\nthat petitioner “waived his right to appeal the district\ncourt’s order of restitution by failing to file a notice of\nappeal from that order” (capitalization omitted)). Accord-\ningly, “the court’s duty to dismiss the appeal was manda-\ntory.” Eberhart, supra, at 18.\n                              B\n  Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his\nsingle notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal\nboth the initial judgment and the amended judgment\nimposing restitution. As we understand it, his argument\ndepends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution\ncase, there is only one “judgment,” as that term is used in\nRules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of\nappeal is filed after the initial judgment, it “springs for-\nward” under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment\nimposing restitution. We reject each of these premises.\n                                1\n    Petitioner argues that the initial judgment deferring\nrestitution and the amended judgment imposing a specific\nrestitution amount merge to become “the judgment” refer-\nenced in the Federal Rules. See Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) (notice\nof appeal must be filed within 14 days after “the entry of\n. . . the judgment . . . being appealed”); Rule 4(b)(2) (“Filing\nBefore Entry of Judgment”). He argues that his notice of\nappeal, which was filed within 14 days of the initial judg-\nment, was therefore sufficient to invoke appellate review\nof the merged judgment.\n    Petitioner’s approach is inconsistent with our reasoning\nin Dolan, 560 U. S. 605. The petitioner in that case ar-\n\u000c6                  MANRIQUE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is\nthe only final, appealable judgment in a deferred restitu-\ntion case. See id., at 616. Although we did not decide\n“whether or when a party can, or must, appeal”—the\nquestion presented here—we were not persuaded by the\nargument that “a sentencing judgment is not ‘final’ until it\ncontains a definitive determination of the amount of resti-\ntution.” Id., at 617–618. To the contrary, we recognized\n“strong arguments” supporting the proposition that both\nthe “initial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of impris-\nonment and supervised release” and the subsequent “ ‘sen-\ntence that impose[d] an order of restitution’ ” were each\nimmediately appealable final judgments. Ibid. (citing 18\nU. S. C. §§3582(b) (imprisonment), 3583(a) (supervised\nrelease), and 3664(o) (restitution)). Consequently, we\nwere not surprised “to find instances where a defendant\nha[d] appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an\ninitial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment” and\n“subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth\nthe final amount of restitution.” 560 U. S., at 618. Our\nanalysis in Dolan thus makes clear that deferred restitu-\ntion cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.*\n                             2\n  Petitioner’s reliance on Rule 4(b)(2) is also misplaced.\nThat Rule provides that a “notice of appeal filed after the\ncourt announces a decision, sentence, or order—but before\nthe entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on\nthe date of and after the entry.” A prematurely filed\nnotice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to\nchallenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.\nAs this Court explained in construing Rule 4(a)(2)’s paral-\n——————\n   * We do not intend to call into question this Court’s decision in Corey\nv. United States, 375 U. S. 169, 176 (1963) (holding that a defendant\nmay challenge his conviction after a single notice of appeal filed from a\nfinal sentence imposed under §4208(b)).\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlel provision for civil cases, the Rule “was intended to\nprotect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal\nfrom a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes\nto be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of\nappeal from the actual final judgment.” FirsTier Mortgage\nCo. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., 498 U. S. 269, 276\n(1991).\n   By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a\nnotice of appeal filed after a sentence has been “an-\nnounce[d]” and before the judgment imposing the sentence\nis entered on the docket. See Rule 4(b)(6) (“A judgment or\norder is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is\nentered on the criminal docket”). If the court has not yet\ndecided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then\nthe Rule does not come into play. Accordingly, it does not\napply where a district court enters an initial judgment\ndeferring restitution and subsequently amends the judg-\nment to include the sentence of restitution. By deferring\nrestitution, the court is declining to announce a sentence.\n   When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case,\nthe District Court had observed only that restitution was\n“mandatory.” App. 27. The court did not announce the\nrestitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue)\nuntil months later. Even if describing restitution as man-\ndatory could qualify as a “sentence” that the District Court\n“announced” under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never\ndisputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.\nRather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the resti-\ntution imposed—an issue the court did not consider until\nmonths later—is unlawful. Because petitioner’s notice of\nappeal was filed well before the District Court announced\nthe sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of\nappeal did not “spring forward” to become effective on the\ndate the court entered its amended judgment imposing\nthat sentence.\n\u000c8               MANRIQUE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              C\n   Finally, petitioner argues in the alternative that any\ndefect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as\nharmless error, citing Lemke v. United States, 346 U. S.\n325 (1953) (per curiam). In that case, the petitioner filed a\nnotice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced\nbut three days before the judgment was entered. Id., at\n326. His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature\nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which\nthen governed notices of appeal in criminal cases. This\nCourt reversed on the ground that the premature filing\nwas harmless error under Rule 52(a). Ibid.\n   The Court’s holding in Lemke does not apply to petitioner’s\nfailure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judg-\nment. Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure in two ways. First, the Lemke peti-\ntioner’s notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule\n4(b)(2). As discussed in Part II–B–2, supra, petitioner\nhere cannot take advantage of that rule. Second, Rule\n3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors\nassociated with filing a notice of appeal. The court of\nappeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice\nof appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice. It\nmay not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at\nall. The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended\njudgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory\nclaim-processing rule, Part II–A, supra, meaning that the\nrequirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as\nthe opposing party raises the issue. By definition, manda-\ntory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture,\nare not subject to harmless-error analysis.\n   Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of\nappeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution,\nbut rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from\nthe amended judgment. Courts do not have discretion to\noverlook such an error, at least where it is called to their\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U.

United States, 546 U. S. 12, 15–19\n(2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 448,\n452–456 (2004). That matter is settled, and the Court,\ntoday, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing\nclaim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders. See, e.g.,\nGonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. 134, 141–143 (2012); Hen-\nderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 435–436, 441–442\n(2011); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413–414\n(2004); cf. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–213 (2007)\n(distinguishing statutory prescriptions from procedural\nrules).\n   As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence\nand conviction when a restitution determination has been\ndeferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal\nhis conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later\nappeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may\nawait the restitution order and then appeal, through a\nsingle notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment,\nand restitution order.

Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:\n    “Appealing a Sentence. After sentencing—regardless\n    of the defendant’s plea—the court must advise the de-\n    fendant of any right to appeal the sentence.”\nThe District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice\nupon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014,\nsee App. 29; that court gave no such advice upon amend-\ning its judgment on September 18, 2014 to include the\namount of restitution ordered, see id., at 10, 46–65. The\nGovernment agrees that the District Court was “absolutely”\nrequired to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the\nrestitution order, and anticipates that the required advice\n“will prevent cases like this from arising again in the\nfuture.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.\n  Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to\nappeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that\nno second notice was required to place the restitution\namount before the Court of Appeals. Without awaiting\nanother appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted\nthe amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the\nCourt of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket\nof the appeal from the conviction and sentence already\npending in that court. App. 10. In turn, the Eleventh\nCircuit’s clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up\nthe transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing.\nSee Docket in No. 14–13029 (CA11).\n  In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the\nclerk’s dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of\nAppeals “confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals.”\nGriggs v.
