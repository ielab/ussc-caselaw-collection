A district court’s\n  factual findings made in the course of this two-step inquiry are re-\n  viewed only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6); Easley\n  v.

Prior to\n  that redistricting, neither district had a majority black voting-age\n  population (BVAP), but both consistently elected the candidates pre-\n  ferred by most African-American voters. The new map significantly\n  altered both District 1 and District 12. The State needed to add al-\n\f2                         COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n most 100,000 people to District 1 to comply with the one-person-one-\n vote principle, and it chose to take most of those people from heavily\n black areas of Durham—increasing the district’s BVAP from 48.6% to\n 52.7%. The State also reconfigured District 12, increasing its BVAP\n from 43.8% to 50.7%. Registered voters in those districts (here called\n “the plaintiffs”) filed suit against North Carolina officials (collective-\n ly, “the State” or “North Carolina”), complaining of impermissible ra-\n cial gerrymanders. A three-judge District Court held both districts\n unconstitutional. It found that racial considerations predominated in\n the drawing of District 1’s lines and rejected the State’s claim that\n this action was justified by the VRA. As for District 12, the court\n again found that race predominated, and it explained that the State\n made no attempt to justify its attention to race in designing that dis-\n trict.\nHeld:\n    1. North Carolina’s victory in a similar state-court lawsuit does not\n dictate the disposition of this case or alter the applicable standard of\n review. Before this case was filed, a state trial court rejected a claim\n by several civil rights groups that Districts 1 and 12 were unlawful\n racial gerrymanders. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed\n that decision under the state-court equivalent of clear error review.\n The State claims that the plaintiffs are members of the same organi-\n zations that brought the earlier case, and thus precluded from raising\n the same questions anew. But the State never satisfied the District\n Court that the alleged affiliation really existed. And because the Dis-\n trict Court’s factual finding was reasonable, it defeats North Caroli-\n na’s attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.\n    The State’s backup argument about the proper standard of review\n also falls short. The rule that a trial court’s factual findings are re-\n viewed only for clear error contains no exception for findings that di-\n verge from those made in another court. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n 52(a)(6). Although the state court’s decision is certainly relevant, the\n premise of clear error review is that there are often “two permissible\n views of the evidence.” Anderson v.

Even assuming that the state court’s findings capture one such\n view, the only question here is whether the District Court’s assess-\n ment represents another. Pp. 7–10.\n    2. The District Court did not err in concluding that race furnished\n the predominant rationale for District 1’s redesign and that the\n State’s interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that con-\n sideration of race. Pp. 10–18.\n       (a) The record shows that the State purposefully established a\n racial target for the district and that the target “had a direct and sig-\n nificant impact” on the district’s configuration, Alabama, 575 U. S.,\n\f                    Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nat ___, subordinating other districting criteria. Faced with this body\nof evidence, the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race\npredominated in drawing District 1; indeed, it could hardly have con-\ncluded anything but. Pp. 10–12.\n     (b) North Carolina’s use of race as the predominant factor in de-\nsigning District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny. The State ar-\ngues that it had good reasons to believe that it had to draw a majori-\nty-minority district to avoid liability for vote dilution under §2 of the\nVRA. Thornburg v. Gingles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, identifies three threshold\nconditions for proving such a vote-dilution claim: (1) A “minority\ngroup” must be “sufficiently large and geographically compact to con-\nstitute a majority” in some reasonably configured legislative district,\nid., at 50; (2) the minority group must be “politically cohesive,” id., at\n51; and (3) a district’s white majority must “vote[ ] sufficiently as a\nbloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s preferred candidate,” ibid. If a\nState has good reason to think that all three of these conditions are\nmet, then so too it has good reason to believe that §2 requires draw-\ning a majority-minority district. But if not, then not.\n   Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a §2 plaintiff\ncould demonstrate the third Gingles prerequisite. For nearly 20\nyears before the new plan’s adoption, African-Americans made up\nless than a majority of District 1’s voters, but their preferred candi-\ndates scored consistent victories. District 1 thus functioned as a\n“crossover” district, in which members of the majority help a “large\nenough” minority to elect its candidate of choice. Bartlett v. Strick-\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145901\"><a href=\"/opinion/145901/bartlett-v-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (plurality opinion). So experience gave the State\nno reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1’s\nBVAP.\n   The State counters that because it needed to substantially increase\nDistrict 1’s population, the question facing the state mapmakers was\nnot whether the then-existing District 1 violated §2, but whether the\nfuture District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race. But\nthat reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify the State’s race-based re-\ndesign of the district. Most important, the State points to no mean-\ningful legislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies: whether a\nnew, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race, could lead\nto §2 liability. To have a strong basis to conclude that §2 demands\nrace-based measures to augment a district’s BVAP, the State must\nevaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the Gingles preconditions\nin a new district created without those measures. Nothing in the leg-\nislative record here fits that description. And that is no accident:\nThe redistricters believed that this Court’s decision in Strickland\nmandated a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1. They apparently reasoned\nthat if, as Strickland held, §2 does not require crossover districts (for\n\f4                           COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    groups insufficiently large under Gingles), then §2 also cannot be sat-\n    isfied by crossover districts (for groups meeting Gingles’ size condi-\n    tion). But, as this Court’s §2 jurisprudence makes clear, unless each\n    of the three Gingles prerequisites is established, “there neither has\n    been a wrong nor can be a remedy.” Growe v. Emison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112818\"><a href=\"/opinion/112818/growe-v-emison/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n    41. North Carolina’s belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1\n    (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district thus\n    rested on a pure error of law. Accordingly, the Court upholds the\n    District Court’s conclusion that the State’s use of race as the predom-\n    inant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.\n    Pp. 12–18.\n       3. The District Court also did not clearly err by finding that race\n    predominated in the redrawing of District 12. Pp. 18–34.\n             (a) The district’s legality turns solely on which of two possible\n    reasons predominantly explains its reconfiguration. The plaintiffs\n    contended at trial that North Carolina intentionally increased Dis-\n    trict 12’s BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under §5 of the\n    VRA. According to the State, by contrast, the mapmakers moved\n    voters in and out of the district as part of a “strictly” political gerry-\n    mander, without regard to race. After hearing evidence supporting\n    both parties’ accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs’.\n       Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special chal-\n    lenges for a trial court, which must make “ ‘a sensitive inquiry’ ” into\n    all “ ‘circumstantial and direct evidence of intent’ ” to assess whether\n    the plaintiffs have proved that race, not politics, drove a district’s\n    lines. Hunt v. Cromartie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087691\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087691/hunt-v-cromartie/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (Cromartie I). This\n    Court’s job is different—and generally easier. It affirms a trial\n    court’s factual finding as to racial predominance so long as the find-\n    ing is “plausible”; it reverses only when “left with the definite and\n    firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470\n    U. S., at 573–574. In assessing a finding’s plausibility, moreover, the\n    Court gives singular deference to a trial court’s judgments about the\n    credibility of witnesses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). Applying\n    those principles here, the evidence at trial—including live witness\n    testimony subject to credibility determinations—adequately supports\n    the District Court’s conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for\n    District 12’s reconfiguration. And contrary to the State’s view, the\n    court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs\n    did not proffer an alternative design for District 12. Pp. 18–21.\n             (b) By slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its\n    snakelike body, North Carolina added 35,000 African-Americans and\n    subtracted 50,000 whites, turning District 12 into a majority-\n    minority district. State Senator Robert Rucho and State Representa-\n    tive David Lewis—the chairs of the two committees responsible for\n\f                   Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npreparing the revamped plan—publicly stated that racial considera-\ntions lay behind District 12’s augmented BVAP. Specifically, Rucho\nand Lewis explained that because part of Guilford County, a jurisdic-\ntion covered by §5 of the VRA, lay in the district, they had increased\nthe district’s BVAP to ensure preclearance of the plan. Dr. Thomas\nHofeller, their hired mapmaker, confirmed that intent. The State’s\npreclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a simi-\nlar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12. And, in\ntestimony that the District Court found credible, Congressman Mel\nWatt testified that Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to him\nin 2011. Hofeller testified that he had drawn District 12’s lines based\non political data, and that he checked the racial data only after he\ndrew a politics-based line between adjacent areas in Guilford County.\nBut the District Court disbelieved Hofeller’s asserted indifference to\nthe new district’s racial composition, pointing to his contrary deposi-\ntion testimony and a significant contradiction in his trial testimony.\nFinally, an expert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs’\ncase, showing that, regardless of party, a black voter in the region\nwas three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot\nwithin District 12’s borders.\n   The District Court’s assessment that all this evidence proved racial\npredominance clears the bar of clear error review. Maybe this Court\nwould have evaluated the testimony differently had it presided over\nthe trial; or then again, maybe it would not have. Either way, the\nCourt is far from having a “definite and firm conviction” that the Dis-\ntrict Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it\nthat racial considerations predominated in District 12’s design.\nPp. 21–28.\n       (c) Finally, North Carolina argues that when race and politics\nare competing explanations of a district’s lines, plaintiffs must intro-\nduce an alternative map that achieves a State’s asserted political\ngoals while improving racial balance. Such a map can serve as key\nevidence in a race-versus-politics dispute, but it is hardly the only\nmeans to disprove a State’s contention that politics drove a district’s\nlines. In this case, the plaintiffs’ introduction of mostly direct and\nsome circumstantial evidence gave the District Court a sufficient ba-\nsis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question. Although a\nplaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical mat-\nter, to make his case, such a map is merely an evidentiary tool to\nshow that an equal protection violation has occurred; neither its\npresence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering\nclaim.\n   North Carolina claims that a passage of this Court’s opinion in\nCromartie II makes an alternative map essential in cases like this\n\f6                           COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    one, but the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading. The\n    Court’s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categori-\n    cal rule that the State claims to find there, and the entire thrust of\n    the opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.\n    Rightly understood, the passage on which the State relies had a dif-\n    ferent and narrower point: Given the weak evidence of a racial ger-\n    rymander offered in Cromartie II, only maps that would actually\n    show what the plaintiffs’ had not could carry the day. This case, in\n    contrast, turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally con-\n    structed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly’s\n    intent in creating the actual District 12—including many hours of\n    trial testimony subject to credibility determinations. That evidence,\n    the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs’ bur-\n    den of debunking North Carolina’s politics defense.

Id., at 574.\n                             B\n  This case concerns North Carolina’s most recent redraw-\ning of two congressional districts, both of which have long\nincluded substantial populations of black voters. In its\ncurrent incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the north-\neastern part of the State, with appendages stretching both\nsouth and west (the latter into Durham). District 12\nbegins in the south-central part of the State (where it\ntakes in a large part of Charlotte) and then travels north-\neast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State’s northern\nborder. (Maps showing the districts are included in an\nappendix to this opinion.) Both have quite the history\nbefore this Court.\n  We first encountered the two districts, in their 1992\nversions, in Shaw v.

There, we\nheld that voters stated an equal protection claim by alleg-\ning that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial ger-\nrymanders. See id., at 642, 649. After a remand to the\nDistrict Court, the case arrived back at our door. See\nShaw II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. That time, we dismissed the\nchallenge to District 1 for lack of standing, but struck\ndown District 12. The design of that “serpentine” district,\nwe held, was nothing if not race-centric, and could not be\njustified as a reasonable attempt to comply with the VRA.\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U.

Racial considerations, we\nheld, did not predominate in designing the revised District\n12. Rather, that district was the result of a political ger-\nrymander—an effort to engineer, mostly “without regard\nto race,” a safe Democratic seat. Id., at 245.\n  The State redrew its congressional districts again in\n2001, to account for population changes revealed in the\nprior year’s census. Under the 2001 map, which went\nunchallenged in court, neither District 1 nor District 12\nhad a black voting-age population (called a “BVAP”) that\nwas a majority of the whole: The former had a BVAP of\naround 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%. See App.\n312, 503. Nonetheless, in five successive general elections\nconducted in those reconfigured districts, all the candi-\ndates preferred by most African-American voters won\ntheir contests—and by some handy margins. In District 1,\nblack voters’ candidates of choice garnered as much as\n70% of the total vote, and never less than 59%. See 5\nRecord 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls. Exh. 112). And in\nDistrict 12, those candidates won with 72% of the vote at\nthe high end and 64% at the low. See id., at 637, 640, 643,\n646, 650.\n  Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet another con-\ngressional map—(finally) the one at issue in this case.\nState Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative\nDavid Lewis, both Republicans, chaired the two commit-\ntees jointly responsible for preparing the revamped plan.\nThey hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a veteran political map-\nmaker, to assist them in redrawing district lines.

The 2010 census had\nrevealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To\ncomply with the Constitution’s one-person-one-vote prin-\nciple, the State needed to place almost 100,000 new people\nwithin the district’s boundaries.

See\nAppendix, infra. With that addition, District 1’s BVAP\nrose from 48.6% to 52.7%. See App. 312–313. District 12,\nfor its part, had no need for significant total-population\nchanges: It was overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people\nout of over 730,000. See id., at 1150. Still, Rucho, Lewis,\nand Hofeller decided to reconfigure the district, further\nnarrowing its already snakelike body while adding areas\nat either end—most relevantly here, in Guilford County.\nSee Appendix, infra; App. 1164. Those changes apprecia-\nbly shifted the racial composition of District 12: As the\ndistrict gained some 35,000 African-Americans of voting\nage and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP\nincreased from 43.8% to 50.7%. See 2 Record 349 (Fourth\nAffidavit of Dan Frey, Exh. 5); id., at 416 (Exh. 11).\n   Registered voters in the two districts (David Harris and\nChristine Bowser, here called “the plaintiffs”) brought this\nsuit against North Carolina officials (collectively, “the\nState” or “North Carolina”), complaining of impermissible\nracial gerrymanders. After a bench trial, a three-judge\nDistrict Court held both districts unconstitutional. All the\njudges agreed that racial considerations predominated in\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U.

And in then applying\nstrict scrutiny, all rejected the State’s argument that it\nhad a “strong basis” for thinking that the VRA compelled\nsuch a race-based drawing of District 1’s lines. Id., at 623.\nAs for District 12, a majority of the panel held that “race\npredominated” over all other factors, including partisan-\nship. Id., at 622. And the court explained that the State\nhad failed to put forward any reason, compelling or other-\nwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.\nSee ibid. Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that\nrace, rather than politics, drove District 12’s lines—yet\nstill characterized the majority’s view as “[e]minently\nreasonable.” Id., at 640.\n  The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted probable\njurisdiction.

As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP\nand several other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1\nand 12 in state court immediately after their enactment,\ncharging that they were unlawful racial gerrymanders.\nSee Brief for Appellants 19–20. By the time the plaintiffs\nbefore us filed this action, the state trial court, in Dickson\nv. Rucho, had rejected those claims—finding that in Dis-\ntrict 1 the VRA justified the General Assembly’s use of\nrace and that in District 12 race was not a factor at all.\nSee App. 1969. The North Carolina Supreme Court then\naffirmed that decision by a 4–3 vote, applying the state-\ncourt equivalent of clear error review. See Dickson v.\nRucho, 368 N.

In this Court, North\n\f8                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCarolina makes two related arguments based on the Dick­\nson litigation: first, that the state trial court’s judgment\nshould have barred this case altogether, under familiar\nprinciples of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that\nthe state court’s conclusions should cause us to conduct a\n“searching review” of the decision below, rather than\ndeferring (as usual) to its factual findings. Reply Brief 6.\n   The State’s preclusion theory rests on an assertion\nabout how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated. As\nthe State acknowledges, one person’s lawsuit generally\ndoes not bar another’s, no matter how similar they are in\nsubstance. See Taylor v. Sturgell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145793\"><a href=\"/opinion/145793/taylor-v-sturgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892–893\n(2008) (noting the “deep-rooted historic tradition that\neveryone should have his own day in court”). But when\nplaintiffs in two cases have a special relationship, a judg-\nment against one can indeed bind both. See id., at 893–\n895 (describing six categories of qualifying relationships).\nThe State contends that Harris and Bowser, the plaintiffs\nhere, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs in\nDickson. And according to North Carolina, that connec-\ntion prevents the pair from raising anew the questions\nthat the state court previously resolved against those\ngroups. See Brief for Appellants 20–21.\n   But North Carolina never satisfied the District Court\nthat the alleged affiliation really existed. When the State\nargued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary\njudgment, Harris and Bowser responded that they were\nnot members of any of the organizations that had brought\nthe Dickson suit. See 3 Record 1577–1582 (Defs. Motion\nfor Summary Judgment); 4 Record 101–106 (Pls. Opposi-\ntion to Motion for Summary Judgment). The parties’\ndueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those\ngroups’ membership policies (e.g., could Harris’s payment\nof dues to the national NAACP, or Bowser’s financial\ncontribution to the Mecklenburg County NAACP, have\nmade either a member of the state branch?).

And nothing in the\nsubsequent trial supported the State’s assertion about\nHarris’s and Bowser’s organizational ties: Indeed, the\nState chose not to present any further evidence relating to\nthe membership issue. Based on the resulting record, the\nDistrict Court summarily rejected the State’s claim that\nHarris and Bowser were something other than independ-\nent plaintiffs. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 609.\n    That conclusion defeats North Carolina’s attempt to\nargue for claim or issue preclusion here. We have no basis\nfor assessing the factual assertions underlying the State’s\nargument any differently than the District Court did.\nNothing in the State’s evidence clearly rebuts Harris’s and\nBowser’s testimony that they never joined any of the\nDickson groups. We need not decide whether the alleged\nmemberships would have supported preclusion if they had\nbeen proved. It is enough that the District Court reason-\nably thought they had not.\n    The State’s back-up argument about our standard of\nreview also falls short. The rule that we review a trial\ncourt’s factual findings for clear error contains no excep-\ntion for findings that diverge from those made in another\ncourt. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6) (“Findings of fact\n. . . must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous”); see\nalso Hernandez v.

Whatever findings are under review\nreceive the benefit of deference, without regard to whether\na court in a separate suit has seen the matter differently.\nSo here, we must ask not which court considering Districts\n1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply\nwhether the court below’s view is clearly wrong. That\ndoes not mean the state court’s decision is wholly irrele-\nvant: It is common sense that, all else equal, a finding is\n\f10                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore likely to be plainly wrong if some judges disagree\nwith it. Cf. Glossip v.

But the very premise of clear\nerror review is that there are often “two permissible”—\nbecause two “plausible”—“views of the evidence.” Ander­\nson, 470 U. S., at 574; see supra, at 4. Even assuming the\nstate court’s findings capture one such view, the District\nCourt’s assessment may yet represent another. And the\npermissibility of the District Court’s account is the only\nquestion before us.\n                             III\n   With that out of the way, we turn to the merits of this\ncase, beginning (appropriately enough) with District 1. As\nnoted above, the court below found that race furnished the\npredominant rationale for that district’s redesign. See\nsupra, at 6–7. And it held that the State’s interest in\ncomplying with the VRA could not justify that considera-\ntion of race. See supra, at 7. We uphold both conclusions.\n                             A\n   Uncontested evidence in the record shows that the\nState’s mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully\nestablished a racial target: African-Americans should\nmake up no less than a majority of the voting-age popula-\ntion. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 611–614. Senator Rucho and\nRepresentative Lewis were not coy in expressing that goal.\nThey repeatedly told their colleagues that District 1 had to\nbe majority-minority, so as to comply with the VRA.\nDuring a Senate debate, for example, Rucho explained\nthat District 1 “must include a sufficient number of\nAfrican-Americans” to make it “a majority black district.”\nApp. 689–690. Similarly, Lewis informed the House and\nSenate redistricting committees that the district must\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave “a majority black voting age population.” Id., at 610.\nAnd that objective was communicated in no uncertain\nterms to the legislators’ consultant. Dr. Hofeller testified\nmultiple times at trial that Rucho and Lewis instructed\nhim “to draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50\npercent.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 613; see, e.g., ibid. (“Once\nagain, my instructions [were] that the district had to be\ndrawn at above 50 percent”).\n  Hofeller followed those directions to the letter, such that\nthe 50%-plus racial target “had a direct and significant\nimpact” on District 1’s configuration. Alabama, 575 U. S.,\nat __ (slip op., at 17). In particular, Hofeller moved the\ndistrict’s borders to encompass the heavily black parts of\nDurham (and only those parts), thus taking in tens of\nthousands of additional African-American voters. That\nchange and similar ones, made (in his words) to ensure\nthat the district’s racial composition would “add[ ] up\ncorrectly,” deviated from the districting practices he other-\nwise would have followed. App. 2802. Hofeller candidly\nadmitted that point: For example, he testified, he some-\ntimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he\nwished because “the more important thing” was to create a\nmajority-minority district. Id., at 2807; see id., at 2809.\nThe result is a district with stark racial borders: Within\nthe same counties, the portions that fall inside District 1\nhave black populations two to three times larger than the\nportions placed in neighboring districts. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 19; cf. Alabama, 575\nU. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18) (relying on similar\nevidence to find racial predominance).\n  Faced with this body of evidence—showing an an-\nnounced racial target that subordinated other districting\ncriteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions\nbetween blacks and whites—the District Court did not\nclearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing\nDistrict 1. Indeed, as all three judges recognized, the\n\f12                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt could hardly have concluded anything but. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

See supra, at 2.\nAnd we have held that race-based districting is narrowly\ntailored to that objective if a State had “good reasons” for\nthinking that the Act demanded such steps. See supra, at\n3. North Carolina argues that District 1 passes muster\nunder that standard: The General Assembly (so says the\nState) had “good reasons to believe it needed to draw\n[District 1] as a majority-minority district to avoid Section\n2 liability” for vote dilution. Brief for Appellants 52. We\nnow turn to that defense.\n  This Court identified, in Thornburg v. Gingles, three\nthreshold conditions for proving vote dilution under §2 of\nthe VRA. See 478 U. S., at 50–51. First, a “minority\ngroup” must be “sufficiently large and geographically\n——————\n   3 The State’s argument to the contrary rests on a legal proposition\n\nthat was foreclosed almost as soon as it was raised in this Court.\nAccording to the State, racial considerations cannot predominate in\ndrawing district lines unless there is an “actual conflict” between those\nlines and “traditional districting principles.” Brief for Appellants 45.\nBut we rejected that view earlier this Term, holding that when (as\nhere) race furnished “the overriding reason for choosing one map over\nothers,” a further showing of “inconsistency between the enacted plan\nand traditional redistricting criteria” is unnecessary to a finding of\nracial predominance.

And in any event, the evi-\ndence recounted in the text indicates that District 1’s boundaries did\nconflict with traditional districting principles—for example, by splitting\nnumerous counties and precincts. See supra, at 11. So we would\nuphold the District Court’s finding of racial predominance even under\nthe (incorrect) legal standard the State proposes.\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U.

Second, the\nminority group must be “politically cohesive.” Id., at 51.\nAnd third, a district’s white majority must “vote[ ] suffi-\nciently as a bloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s pre-\nferred candidate.” Ibid. Those three showings, we have\nexplained, are needed to establish that “the minority\n[group] has the potential to elect a representative of its\nown choice” in a possible district, but that racially polar-\nized voting prevents it from doing so in the district as\nactually drawn because it is “submerg[ed] in a larger\nwhite voting population.” Growe v.

In the lingo of voting law, District 1 func-\ntioned, election year in and election year out, as a “cross-\nover” district, in which members of the majority help a\n“large enough” minority to elect its candidate of choice.\nBartlett v. Strickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145901\"><a href=\"/opinion/145901/bartlett-v-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (2009) (plurality\nopinion). When voters act in that way, “[i]t is difficult to\nsee how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be\nmet”—and hence how §2 liability could be established. Id.,\nat 16. So experience gave the State no reason to think\nthat the VRA required it to ramp up District 1’s BVAP.\n   The State counters that, in this context, past perfor-\nmance is no guarantee of future results. See Brief for\nAppellants 57–58; Reply Brief 19–20. Recall here that the\nState had to redraw its whole congressional map following\nthe 2010 census. See supra, at 5. And in particular, the\nState had to add nearly 100,000 new people to District 1 to\nmeet the one-person-one-vote standard. See supra, at 6.\nThat meant about 13% of the voters in the new district\nwould never have voted there before. See App. 2690;\nReply Brief 20. So, North Carolina contends, the question\nfacing the state mapmakers was not whether the then-\nexisting District 1 violated §2. Rather, the question was\nwhether the future District 1 would do so if drawn without\nregard to race. And that issue, the State claims, could not\nbe resolved by “focusing myopically on past elections.” Id.,\nat 19.\n   But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify North\nCarolina’s race-based redesign of District 1. True enough,\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

And true\ntoo, an inescapable influx of additional voters into a dis-\ntrict may suggest the possibility that its former track\nrecord of compliance can continue only if the legislature\nintentionally adjusts its racial composition. Still, North\nCarolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime\npattern of white crossover voting in the area that would\nform the core of the redrawn District 1. See Gingles, 478\nU. S., at 57 (noting that longtime voting patterns are\nhighly probative of racial polarization). And even more\nimportant, North Carolina can point to no meaningful\nlegislative inquiry into what it now rightly identifies as\nthe key issue: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created\nwithout a focus on race but however else the State would\nchoose, could lead to §2 liability. The prospect of a signifi-\ncant population increase in a district only raises—it does\nnot answer—the question whether §2 requires deliberate\nmeasures to augment the district’s BVAP. (Indeed, such\npopulation growth could cut in either direction, depending\non who comes into the district.) To have a strong basis in\nevidence to conclude that §2 demands such race-based\nsteps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a plain-\ntiff could establish the Gingles preconditions—including\neffective white bloc-voting—in a new district created\nwithout those measures. We see nothing in the legislative\nrecord that fits that description.5\n——————\n  5 North  Carolina calls our attention to two expert reports on voting\npatterns throughout the State, but neither casts light on the relevant\nissue. The first (by Dr. Thomas Brunell) showed that some elections in\nmany of the State’s counties exhibited “statistically significant” racially\npolarized voting. App. 1001. The second (by Dr. Ray Block) found that\nin various elections across the State, white voters were “noticeably” less\nlikely than black voters to support black candidates. Id., at 959. From\nthose far-flung data points—themselves based only on past elections—\n\f16                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  And that absence is no accident: Rucho and Lewis pro-\nceeded under a wholly different theory—arising not from\nGingles but from Bartlett v. Strickland—of what §2 de-\nmanded in drawing District 1. Strickland involved a\ngeographic area in which African-Americans could not\nform a majority of a reasonably compact district. See 556\nU. S., at 8 (plurality opinion). The African-American\ncommunity, however, was sizable enough to enable the\nformation of a crossover district, in which a substantial\nbloc of black voters, if receiving help from some white\nones, could elect the candidates of their choice. See supra,\nat 14. A plurality of this Court, invoking the first Gingles\nprecondition, held that §2 did not require creating that\ndistrict: When a minority group is not sufficiently large to\nmake up a majority in a reasonably shaped district, §2\nsimply does not apply. See 556 U. S., at 18–20. Over and\nover in the legislative record, Rucho and Lewis cited\nStrickland as mandating a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.\nSee App. 355–356, 363–364, 472–474, 609–610, 619, 1044.\nThey apparently reasoned that if, as Strickland held, §2\ndoes not require crossover districts (for groups insufficiently\nlarge under Gingles), then §2 also cannot be satisfied by\ncrossover districts (for groups in fact meeting Gingles’ size\ncondition). In effect, they concluded, whenever a legisla-\nture can draw a majority-minority district, it must do so—\neven if a crossover district would also allow the minority\n——————\nthe experts opined (to no one’s great surprise) that in North Carolina,\nas in most States, there are discernible, non-random relationships\nbetween race and voting. But as the District Court found, see Harris v.\nMcCrory, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S., at 56. And so the reports do not answer whether the\nlegislature needed to boost District 1’s BVAP to avoid potential §2\nliability.\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U.

See 1 Tr. 21–22\n(counsel’s explanation that “the [S]tate interpreted”\nStrickland to say that, in order to protect African-\nAmericans’ electoral strength and thus avoid §2 liability,\nthe BVAP in District 1 “need[ed] to be above 50 percent”).\n  That idea, though, is at war with our §2 jurisprudence—\nStrickland included. Under the State’s view, the third\nGingles condition is no condition at all, because even in\nthe absence of effective white bloc-voting, a §2 claim could\nsucceed in a district (like the old District 1) with an under-\n50% BVAP. But this Court has made clear that unless\neach of the three Gingles prerequisites is established,\n“there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.”\nGrowe, 507 U. S., at 41. And Strickland, far from support-\ning North Carolina’s view, underscored the necessity of\ndemonstrating effective white bloc-voting to prevail in a §2\nvote-dilution suit. The plurality explained that “[i]n areas\nwith substantial crossover voting,” §2 plaintiffs would not\n“be able to establish the third Gingles precondition” and so\n“majority-minority districts would not be required.” 556\nU. S., at 24; see also ibid. (noting that States can “defend\nagainst alleged §2 violations by pointing to crossover\nvoting patterns and to effective crossover districts”).\nThus, North Carolina’s belief that it was compelled to\nredraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a\nmajority-minority district rested not on a “strong basis in\nevidence,” but instead on a pure error of law. Alabama,\n575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).\n  In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take race-based\nactions reasonably judged necessary under a proper inter-\npretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District\n1. We by no means “insist that a state legislature, when\nredistricting, determine precisely what percent minority\npopulation [§2 of the VRA] demands.” Ibid. But neither\nwill we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is\nsupported by no evidence and whose raison d’être is a legal\n\f18                        COOPER v.

Accordingly, we uphold the District Court’s\nconclusion that North Carolina’s use of race as the pre-\ndominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand\nstrict scrutiny.\n                              IV\n   We now look west to District 12, making its fifth(!)\nappearance before this Court. This time, the district’s\nlegality turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible\nreasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfigu-\nration. The plaintiffs contended at trial that the General\nAssembly chose voters for District 12, as for District 1,\nbecause of their race; more particularly, they urged that\nthe Assembly intentionally increased District 12’s BVAP\nin the name of ensuring preclearance under the VRA’s §5.\nBut North Carolina declined to mount any defense (simi-\nlar to the one we have just considered for District 1) that\n§5’s requirements in fact justified race-based changes to\nDistrict 12—perhaps because §5 could not reasonably be\nunderstood to have done so, see n. 10, infra. Instead, the\nState altogether denied that racial considerations ac-\ncounted for (or, indeed, played the slightest role in) Dis-\ntrict 12’s redesign. According to the State’s version of\nevents, Senator Rucho, Representative Lewis, and Dr.\nHofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a\n“strictly” political gerrymander, without regard to race. 6\nRecord 1011. The mapmakers drew their lines, in other\nwords, to “pack” District 12 with Democrats, not African-\nAmericans. After hearing evidence supporting both par-\nties’ accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs’.6\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE ALITO charges us with “ignor[ing]” the State’s political-\n\ngerrymander defense, making our analysis “like Hamlet without the\nprince.” Post, at 20 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); see post, at 20, 34. But we simply\ntake the State’s account for what it is: one side of a thoroughly two-\nsided case (and, as we will discuss, the side the District Court rejected,\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

In the more usual case\nalleging a racial gerrymander—where no one has raised a\npartisanship defense—the court can make real headway\nby exploring the challenged district’s conformity to tradi-\ntional districting principles, such as compactness and\nrespect for county lines. In Shaw II, for example, this\nCourt emphasized the “highly irregular” shape of then-\nDistrict 12 in concluding that race predominated in its\ndesign. 517 U. S., at 905 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). But such evidence loses much of its value when the\nState asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre\nshape—as of the new District 12—can arise from a “politi-\ncal motivation” as well as a racial one. Cromartie I, 526\nU. S., at 547, n. 3. And crucially, political and racial rea-\nsons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district’s\nboundaries. That is because, of course, “racial identifica-\ntion is highly correlated with political affiliation.”\nCromartie II, 532 U. S., at 243. As a result of those redis-\ntricting realities, a trial court has a formidable task: It\nmust make “a sensitive inquiry” into all “circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent” to assess whether the plain-\ntiffs have managed to disentangle race from politics and\n——————\nprimarily on factual grounds). By contrast, the dissent consistently\ntreats the State’s version of events (what it calls “the Legislature’s\npolitical strategy and the relationship between that strategy and\n[District 12’s] racial composition,” post, at 20) as if it were a simple “fact\nof the matter”—the premise of, rather than a contested claim in, this\ncase. See post, at 12–14, 16, 20, 26, 27–29, 33. The dissent’s narrative\nthus tracks, top-to-bottom and point-for-point, the testimony of Dr.\nHofeller, the State’s star witness at trial—so much so that the dissent\ncould just have block-quoted that portion of the transcript and saved\nitself a fair bit of trouble. Compare post, at 12–20, with App. 2671–\n2755. Imagine (to update the dissent’s theatrical reference) Inherit the\nWind retold solely from the perspective of William Jennings Bryan,\nwith nary a thought given to the competing viewpoint of Clarence\nDarrow.\n\f20                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove that the former drove a district’s lines. Cromartie I,\n526 U. S., at 546 (internal quotation marks omitted).7\n   Our job is different—and generally easier. As described\nearlier, we review a district court’s finding as to racial\npredominance only for clear error, except when the court\nmade a legal mistake. See supra, at 3–4. Under that\nstandard of review, we affirm the court’s finding so long as\nit is “plausible”; we reverse only when “left with the defi-\nnite and firm conviction that a mistake has been commit-\nted.” Anderson, 470 U. S., at 573–574; see supra, at 4.\nAnd in deciding which side of that line to come down on,\nwe give singular deference to a trial court’s judgments\nabout the credibility of witnesses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n52(a)(6). That is proper, we have explained, because the\nvarious cues that “bear so heavily on the listener’s under-\nstanding of and belief in what is said” are lost on an appel-\nlate court later sifting through a paper record. Anderson,\n470 U. S., at 575.8\n——————\n  7 As  earlier noted, that inquiry is satisfied when legislators have\n“place[d] a significant number of voters within or without” a district\npredominantly because of their race, regardless of their ultimate\nobjective in taking that step. See supra, at 2, and n. 1. So, for example,\nif legislators use race as their predominant districting criterion with\nthe end goal of advancing their partisan interests—perhaps thinking\nthat a proposed district is more “sellable” as a race-based VRA compli-\nance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish\nmuch the same thing—their action still triggers strict scrutiny. See\nVera, 517 U. S., at 968–970 (plurality opinion). In other words, the\nsorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even if\nrace is meant to function as a proxy for other (including political)\ncharacteristics. See Miller, 515 U. S., at 914.\n   8 Undeterred by these settled principles, the dissent undertakes to\n\nrefind the facts of this case at every turn. See post, at 11–33. Indeed,\nthe dissent repeatedly flips the appropriate standard of review—\narguing, for example, that the District Court’s is not “the only plausible\ninterpretation” of one piece of contested evidence and that the State\noffered an “entirely natural” view of another. Post, at 24, 31; see also\npost, at 20, 26, 27, 33. Underlying that approach to the District Court’s\nfactfinding is an elemental error: The dissent mistakes the rule that a\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In light of those principles, we uphold the District\nCourt’s finding of racial predominance respecting District\n12. The evidence offered at trial, including live witness\ntestimony subject to credibility determinations, adequately\nsupports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted\nfor the district’s reconfiguration. And no error of law\ninfected that judgment: Contrary to North Carolina’s view,\nthe District Court had no call to dismiss this challenge\njust because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative\ndesign for District 12 as circumstantial evidence of the\nlegislature’s intent.\n                               A\n   Begin with some facts and figures, showing how the\nredistricting of District 12 affected its racial composition.\nAs explained above, District 12 (unlike District 1) was\napproximately the right size as it was: North Carolina did\nnot—indeed, could not—much change its total population.\nSee supra, at 6. But by further slimming the district and\nadding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body (including\nin Guilford County), the General Assembly incorporated\ntens of thousands of new voters and pushed out tens of\nthousands of old ones. And those changes followed racial\nlines: To be specific, the new District 12 had 35,000 more\nAfrican-Americans of voting age and 50,000 fewer whites\nof that age. (The difference was made up of voters from\nother racial categories.) See ibid. Those voter exchanges\nproduced a sizable jump in the district’s BVAP, from\n43.8% to 50.7%. See ibid. The Assembly thus turned\nDistrict 12 (as it did District 1, see supra, at 10–11) into a \n\nmajority-minority district.\n\n—————— \n\nlegislature’s good faith should be presumed “until a claimant makes a\nshowing sufficient to support th[e] allegation” of “race-based deci-\nsionmaking,” Miller, 515 U. S., at 915, for a kind of super-charged, pro-\nState presumption on appeal, trumping clear-error review. See post, at\n11–12, n. 7.\n\f22                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   As the plaintiffs pointed out at trial, Rucho and Lewis\nhad publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind\nDistrict 12’s augmented BVAP. In a release issued along\nwith their draft districting plan, the two legislators as-\ncribed that change to the need to achieve preclearance of\nthe plan under §5 of the VRA. See App. 358. At that time,\n§5 covered Guilford County and thus prohibited any “ret-\nrogression in the [electoral] position of racial minorities”\nthere. Beer, 425 U. S., at 141; see 31 Fed. Reg. 5081\n(1966). And part of Guilford County lay within District\n12, which meant that the Department of Justice would\nclosely scrutinize that district’s new lines. In light of those\nfacts, Rucho and Lewis wrote: “Because of the presence of\nGuilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn\nour proposed Twelfth District at a [BVAP] level that is\nabove the percentage of [BVAP] found in the current\nTwelfth District.” App. 358. According to the two legisla-\ntors, that race-based “measure w[ould] ensure preclear-\nance of the plan.” Ibid. Thus, the District Court found,\nRucho’s and Lewis’s own account “evince[d] intentionality”\nas to District 12’s racial composition: Because of the VRA,\nthey increased the number of African-Americans. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Before the redistricting,\nHofeller testified, some black residents of Guilford County\nfell within District 12 while others fell within neighboring\nDistrict 13. The legislators, he continued, “decided to\nreunite the black community in Guilford County into the\nTwelfth.” App. 558; see id., at 530–531. Why?

Likewise, Hofeller’s expert report\nhighlighted the role of the VRA in altering District 12’s\nlines. “[M]indful that Guilford County was covered” by §5,\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U.

App. 1103. That change caused\nthe district’s compactness to decrease (in expert-speak, it\n“lowered the Reock Score”), but that was a sacrifice well\nworth making: It would “avoid the possibility of a [VRA]\ncharge” that would “inhibit[ ] preclearance.” Ibid.\n   The State’s preclearance submission to the Justice\nDepartment indicated a similar determination to concen-\ntrate black voters in District 12. “One of the concerns of\nthe Redistricting Chairs,” North Carolina there noted, had\nto do with the Justice Department’s years-old objection to\n“a failure by the State to create a second majority minority\ndistrict” (that is, in addition to District 1). Id., at 478.\nThe submission then went on to explain that after consid-\nering alternatives, the redistricters had designed a version\nof District 12 that would raise its BVAP to 50.7%. Thus,\nconcluded the State, the new District 12 “increases[ ] the\nAfrican-American community’s ability to elect their candi-\ndate of choice.” Id., at 479. In the District Court’s view,\nthat passage once again indicated that making District 12\nmajority-minority was no “mere coincidence,” but a delib-\nerate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

According to Watt, Rucho\n——————\n  9 The dissent’s contrary reading of the preclearance submission—as\n\nreporting the redistricters’ “decis[ion] not to construct District 12 as a\nmajority-minority district,” post, at 24—is difficult to fathom. The\nlanguage the dissent cites explains only why Rucho and Lewis rejected\none particular way of creating such a district; the submission then\nrelates their alternative (and, of course, successful) approach to attain-\ning an over-50% BVAP.

And he told Rucho that “the\nAfrican-American community will laugh at you” too. Ibid. Watt\nexplained to Rucho: “I’m getting 65 percent of the vote in a 40 percent\nblack district. If you ramp my [BVAP] to over 50 percent, I’ll probably\nget 80 percent of the vote, and[ ] that’s not what the Voting Rights Act\nwas designed to do.” Ibid.\n  11 The court acknowledged that, in the earlier state-court trial involv-\n\ning District 12, Rucho denied making the comments that Watt recalled.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But the court explained that it could\nnot “assess [the] credibility” of Rucho’s contrary account because even\nthough he was listed as a defense witness and present in the courtroom\nthroughout the trial, the State chose not to put him on the witness\nstand. Id., at 618.\n  12 The dissent conjures a different way of explaining Watt’s testi-\n\nmony. Perhaps, the dissent suggests, Rucho disclosed a majority-minority\ntarget to Watt, but Watt then changed Rucho’s mind—and perhaps it\nwas just a coincidence (or a mistake?) that Rucho still created a 50.7%-\nBVAP district. See post, at 25–26. But nothing in the record supports\nthat hypothesis. See ibid. (relying exclusively on the State’s preclear-\nance submission to back up this story); supra, at 23, and n. 9 (correcting\nthe dissent’s misreading of that submission). And the State, lacking\nthe dissent’s creativity, did not think to present it at trial.\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State’s contrary story—that politics alone drove\ndecisionmaking—came into the trial mostly through Ho-\nfeller’s testimony. Hofeller explained that Rucho and\nLewis instructed him, first and foremost, to make the map\nas a whole “more favorable to Republican candidates.”\nApp. 2682. One agreed-on stratagem in that effort was to\npack the historically Democratic District 12 with even\nmore Democratic voters, thus leaving surrounding dis-\ntricts more reliably Republican. See id., at 2682–2683,\n2696–2697. To that end, Hofeller recounted, he drew\nDistrict 12’s new boundaries based on political data—\nspecifically, the voting behavior of precincts in the 2008\nPresidential election between Barack Obama and John\nMcCain. See id., at 2701–2702. Indeed, he claimed, he\ndisplayed only this data, and no racial data, on his com-\nputer screen while mapping the district. See id., at 2721.\nIn part of his testimony, Hofeller further stated that the\nObama-McCain election data explained (among other\nthings) his incorporation of the black, but not the white,\nparts of Guilford County then located in District 13. See\nid., at 2824. Only after he drew a politics-based line be-\ntween those adjacent areas, Hofeller testified, did he\n“check[ ]” the racial data and “f[ind] out” that the resulting\nconfiguration of District 12 “did not have a [§5] issue.” Id.,\nat 2822.\n   The District Court, however, disbelieved Hofeller’s\nasserted indifference to the new district’s racial composi-\ntion. The court recalled Hofeller’s contrary deposition\ntestimony—his statement (repeated in only slightly differ-\nent words in his expert report) that Rucho and Lewis\n“decided” to shift African-American voters into District 12\n“in order to” ensure preclearance under §5. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

And the court ex-\nplained that even at trial, Hofeller had given testimony\nthat undermined his “blame it on politics” claim. Right\nafter asserting that Rucho and Lewis had told him “[not]\n\f26                        COOPER v.

As the District\nCourt understood, that is the kind of “exception” that goes\npretty far toward swallowing the rule. District 12 saw a\nnet increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford\nCounty, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across\nthe district: So the newly added parts of that county\nplayed a major role in pushing the district’s BVAP over\n50%. See id., at 384, 500–502.13 The District Court came\naway from Hofeller’s self-contradictory testimony unper-\nsuaded that this decisive influx of black voters was an\naccident. Whether the racial make-up of the county was\ndisplayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his head,\nthe court thought, Hofeller’s denial of race-based district-\ning “r[ang] hollow.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Ansolabehere looked at the six counties\noverlapping with District 12—essentially the region from\nwhich the mapmakers could have drawn the district’s\npopulation. The question he asked was: Who from those\ncounties actually ended up in District 12? The answer he\nfound was: Only 16% of the region’s white registered\nvoters, but 64% of the black ones. See App. 321–322.\nAnsolabehere next controlled for party registration, but\n——————\n  13 The dissent charges that this comparison is misleading, but offers\nno good reason why that is so. See post, at 29–30. It is quite true, as\nthe dissent notes, that another part of District 12 (in Mecklenburg\nCounty) experienced a net increase in black voters even larger than the\none in Guilford County. See post, at 30. (The net increases in the two\ncounties thus totaled more than 35,000; they were then partially offset\nby net decreases in other counties in District 12.) But that is irrelevant\nto the point made here: Without the numerous black voters added to\nDistrict 12 in Guilford County—where the evidence most clearly\nindicates voters were chosen based on race—the district would have\nfallen well shy of majority-minority status.\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    27\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovered that doing so made essentially no difference:\nFor example, only 18% of the region’s white Democrats\nwound up in District 12, whereas 65% of the black Demo-\ncrats did. See id., at 332. The upshot was that, regardless\nof party, a black voter was three to four times more likely\nthan a white voter to cast his ballot within District 12’s\nborders. See ibid. Those stark disparities led An-\nsolabehere to conclude that “race, and not party,” was “the\ndominant factor” in District 12’s design. Id., at 337.14 His\nreport, as the District Court held, thus tended to confirm\nthe plaintiffs’ direct evidence of racial predominance. See\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 620–621.\n  The District Court’s assessment that all this evidence\nproved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error\nreview. The court emphasized that the districting plan’s\nown architects had repeatedly described the influx of\nAfrican-Americans into District 12 as a §5 compliance\nmeasure, not a side-effect of political gerrymandering.\n——————\n  14 Hofeller did not dispute Ansolabehere’s figures, but questioned his\ninference. Those striking patterns, the mapmaker claimed, were\nnothing more than the result of his own reliance on voting data from\nthe 2008 Presidential election—because that information (i.e., who\nvoted for Obama and who for McCain) tracked race better than it did\nparty registration. See App. 1101, 1111–1114; cf. Cromartie II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (2001) (recognizing that “party registration and party\npreference do not always correspond”). As we have just recounted,\nhowever, the District Court had other reasons to disbelieve Hofeller’s\ntestimony that he used solely that electoral data to draw District 12’s\nlines. See supra, at 25–26. And Ansolabehere contended that even if\nHofeller did so, that choice of data could itself suggest an intent to sort\nvoters by race. Voting results from a “single [Presidential] election\nwith a Black candidate,” Ansolabehere explained, would be a “problem-\natic and unusual” indicator of future party preference, because of the\nracial dynamics peculiar to such a match-up. App. 341; see id., at 342–\n343. That data would, indeed, be much more useful as a reflection of an\narea’s racial composition: “The Obama vote,” Ansolabehere found, is “an\nextremely strong positive indicator of the location of Black registered\nvoters” and, conversely, an “extremely strong negative indicator of the\nlocation of White registered voters.” Id., at 342; see id., at 2546–2550.\n\f28                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd those contemporaneous descriptions comported with\nthe court’s credibility determinations about the trial tes-\ntimony—that Watt told the truth when he recounted\nRucho’s resolve to hit a majority-BVAP target; and con-\nversely that Hofeller skirted the truth (especially as to\nGuilford County) when he claimed to have followed only\nrace-blind criteria in drawing district lines. We cannot\ndisrespect such credibility judgments. See Anderson, 470\nU. S., at 575 (A choice to believe “one of two or more wit-\nnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially\nplausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evi-\ndence,” can “virtually never be clear error”). And more\ngenerally, we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the\ntrial evidence as if we were the first to hear it. See id., at\n573 (A “reviewing court oversteps” under Rule 52(a) “if it\nundertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court”). No\ndoubt other interpretations of that evidence were permis-\nsible. Maybe we would have evaluated the testimony\ndifferently had we presided over the trial; or then again,\nmaybe we would not have. Either way—and it is only this\nwhich matters—we are far from having a “definite and\nfirm conviction” that the District Court made a mistake in\nconcluding from the record before it that racial considera-\ntions predominated in District 12’s design.\n                              B\n  The State mounts a final, legal rather than factual,\nattack on the District Court’s finding of racial predomi-\nnance. When race and politics are competing explanations\nof a district’s lines, argues North Carolina, the party\nchallenging the district must introduce a particular kind\nof circumstantial evidence: “an alternative [map] that\nachieves the legislature’s political objectives while improv-\ning racial balance.” Brief for Appellants 31 (emphasis\ndeleted). That is true, the State says, irrespective of what\nother evidence is in the case—so even if the plaintiff offers\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npowerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map\nit did for racial reasons. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Because\nthe plaintiffs here (as all agree) did not present such a\ncounter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot\nprevail. The dissent echoes that argument. See post, at\n6–11.\n   We have no doubt that an alternative districting plan, of\nthe kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key evi-\ndence in a race-versus-politics dispute. One, often highly\npersuasive way to disprove a State’s contention that poli-\ntics drove a district’s lines is to show that the legislature\nhad the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals with-\nout moving so many members of a minority group into the\ndistrict. If you were really sorting by political behavior\ninstead of skin color (so the argument goes) you would\nhave done—or, at least, could just as well have done—this.\nSuch would-have, could-have, and (to round out the set)\nshould-have arguments are a familiar means of undermin-\ning a claim that an action was based on a permissible,\nrather than a prohibited, ground. See, e.g., Miller-El v.\nDretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249 (2005) (“If that were the [real]\nexplanation for striking [juror] Warren[,] the prosecutors\nshould have struck [juror] Jenkins” too).\n   But they are hardly the only means. Suppose that the\nplaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of\nleaked emails from state officials instructing their map-\nmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a\ndistrict, or telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%.\nBased on such evidence, a court could find that racial\nrather than political factors predominated in a district’s\ndesign, with or without an alternative map. And so too in\ncases lacking that kind of smoking gun, as long as the\nevidence offered satisfies the plaintiff ’s burden of proof.\nIn Bush v. Vera, for example, this Court upheld a finding\nof racial predominance based on “substantial direct evi-\ndence of the legislature’s racial motivations”—including\n\f30                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredible testimony from political figures and statements\nmade in a §5 preclearance submission—plus circumstan-\ntial evidence that redistricters had access to racial, but not\npolitical, data at the “block-by-block level” needed to ex-\nplain their “intricate” designs. See 517 U. S., at 960–963\n(plurality opinion). Not a single Member of the Court\nthought that the absence of a counter-map made any\ndifference. Similarly, it does not matter in this case,\nwhere the plaintiffs’ introduction of mostly direct and\nsome circumstantial evidence—documents issued in the\nredistricting process, testimony of government officials,\nexpert analysis of demographic patterns—gave the Dis-\ntrict Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the\nrace-or-politics question.\n   A plaintiff ’s task, in other words, is simply to persuade\nthe trial court—without any special evidentiary prerequi-\nsite—that race (not politics) was the “predominant consid-\neration in deciding to place a significant number of voters\nwithin or without a particular district.” Alabama, 575\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); cf. Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 8, 10) (rejecting a similar effort to elevate one form of\n“persuasive circumstantial evidence” in a dispute respect-\ning racial predominance to a “mandatory precondition” or\n“threshold requirement” of proof). That burden of proof,\nwe have often held, is “demanding.” E.g., Cromartie II,\n532 U. S., at 241. And because that is so, a plaintiff will\nsometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter,\nto make his case. But in no area of our equal protection\nlaw have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form\nof proof to prevail. See Arlington Heights v.

An alternative\nmap is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a\nsubstantive violation has occurred; neither its presence\nnor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering\nclaim.15\n   North Carolina insists, however, that we have already\nsaid to the contrary—more particularly, that our decision\nin Cromartie II imposed a non-negotiable “alternative-map\nrequirement.” Brief for Appellants 31. As the State ob-\nserves, Cromartie II reversed as clearly erroneous a trial\ncourt’s finding that race, rather than politics, predominated\n——————\n   15 The dissent responds that an alternative-map requirement “should\n\nnot be too hard” for plaintiffs (or at least “sophisticated” litigants “like\nthose in the present case”) to meet. Post, at 10–11. But if the plaintiffs\nhave already proved by a preponderance of the evidence that race\npredominated in drawing district lines, then we have no warrant to\ndemand that they jump through additional evidentiary hoops (whether\nthe exercise would cost a hundred dollars or a million, a week’s more\ntime or a year’s). Or at least that would be so if we followed the usual\nrules. Underlying the dissent’s view that we should not—that we\nshould instead create a special evidentiary burden—is its belief that\n“litigation of this sort” often seeks to “obtain in court what [a political\nparty] could not achieve in the political arena,” post, at 9, and so that\nlittle is lost by making suits like this one as hard as possible. But\nwhatever the possible motivations for bringing such suits (and the\ndissent says it is not questioning “what occurred here,” ibid.), they\nserve to prevent legislatures from taking unconstitutional districting\naction—which happens more often than the dissent must suppose.\nState lawmakers sometimes misunderstand the VRA’s requirements\n(as may have occurred here with respect to §5), leading them to employ\nrace as a predominant districting criterion when they should not. See\nsupra, at 22–24, and n. 10. Or they may resort to race-based districting\nfor ultimately political reasons, leveraging the strong correlation\nbetween race and voting behavior to advance their partisan interests.\nSee nn. 1, 7, supra. Or, finally—though we hope less commonly—they\nmay simply seek to suppress the electoral power of minority voters.\nWhen plaintiffs meet their burden of showing that such conduct has\noccurred, there is no basis for subjecting them to additional—and\nunique—evidentiary hurdles, preventing them from receiving the\nremedy to which they are entitled.\n\f32                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the assignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of\nDistrict 12. See 532 U. S., at 241; supra, at 5. And as the\nState emphasizes, a part of our opinion faulted the\nCromartie plaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing ac-\ncount of how the legislature could have accomplished its\npolitical goals other than through the map it chose. See\n532 U. S., at 257–258. We there stated:\n     “In a case such as this one where majority-minority\n     districts . . . are at issue and where racial identifica-\n     tion correlates highly with political affiliation, the\n     party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries\n     must show at the least that the legislature could have\n     achieved its legitimate political objectives in alterna-\n     tive ways that are comparably consistent with tradi-\n     tional districting principles. That party must also\n     show that those districting alternatives would have\n     brought about significantly greater racial balance.”\n     Id., at 258.\nAccording to North Carolina, that passage alone settles\nthis case, because it makes an alternative map “essential”\nto a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district\nin which race and partisanship are correlated) was a racial\ngerrymander. Reply Brief 11. Once again, the dissent\nsays the same. See post, at 7.\n   But the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading.\nThe Court’s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or\njustify the categorical rule that the State claims to find\nthere. (Certainly the dissent’s current defense of that\nrule, see post, at 8–11, was nowhere in evidence.) And\ngiven the strangeness of that rule—which would treat a\nmere form of evidence as the very substance of a constitu-\ntional claim, see supra, at 29–31—we cannot think that\nthe Court adopted it without any explanation. Still more,\nthe entire thrust of the Cromartie II opinion runs counter\nto an inflexible counter-map requirement. If the Court\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhad adopted that rule, it would have had no need to weigh\neach piece of evidence in the case and determine whether,\ntaken together, they were “adequate” to show “the pre-\ndominance of race in the legislature’s line-drawing pro-\ncess.” 532 U. S., at 243–244. But that is exactly what\nCromartie II did, over a span of 20 pages and in exhaus-\ntive detail. Item by item, the Court discussed and disman-\ntled the supposed proof, both direct and circumstantial, of\nrace-based redistricting. All that careful analysis would\nhave been superfluous—that dogged effort wasted—if the\nCourt viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of\nevidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.\n   Rightly understood, the passage from Cromartie II had a\ndifferent and narrower point, arising from and reflecting\nthe evidence offered in that case. The direct evidence of a\nracial gerrymander, we thought, was extremely weak: We\nsaid of one piece that it “says little or nothing about\nwhether race played a predominant role” in drawing dis-\ntrict lines; we said of another that it “is less persuasive\nthan the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant\nin other redistricting cases.” Id., at 253–254 (emphasis\ndeleted). Nor did the report of the plaintiffs’ expert im-\npress us overmuch: In our view, it “offer[ed] little insight\ninto the legislature’s true motive.” Id., at 248. That left a\nset of arguments of the would-have-could-have variety.\nFor example, the plaintiffs offered several maps purport-\ning to “show how the legislature might have swapped”\nsome mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain\ngreater racial balance “without harming [the legislature’s]\npolitical objective.” Id., at 255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court determined that none of those\nproposed exchanges would have worked as advertised—\nessentially, that the plaintiffs’ “you could have redistricted\ndifferently” arguments failed on their own terms. See id.,\nat 254–257. Hence emerged the demand quoted above, for\nmaps that would actually show what the plaintiffs’ had\n\f34                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot. In a case like Cromartie II—that is, one in which the\nplaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerry-\nmander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alterna-\ntives—only maps of that kind could carry the day. Id., at\n258.\n   But this case is most unlike Cromartie II, even though it\ninvolves the same electoral district some twenty years on.\nThis case turned not on the possibility of creating more\noptimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of\nthe General Assembly’s intent in creating the actual Dis-\ntrict 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to\ncredibility determinations. That evidence, the District\nCourt plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs’ burden\nof debunking North Carolina’s “it was really politics”\ndefense; there was no need for an alternative map to do\nthe same job. And we pay our precedents no respect when\nwe extend them far beyond the circumstances for which\nthey were designed.\n                              V\n  Applying a clear error standard, we uphold the District\nCourt’s conclusions that racial considerations predominated\nin designing both District 1 and District 12. For District\n12, that is all we must do, because North Carolina has\nmade no attempt to justify race-based districting there.\nFor District 1, we further uphold the District Court’s\ndecision that §2 of the VRA gave North Carolina no good\nreason to reshuffle voters because of their race. We ac-\ncordingly affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of

S., at 256.\n   A critical factor in our analysis was the failure of those\nchallenging the district to come forward with an alterna-\ntive redistricting map that served the legislature’s politi-\ncal objective as well as the challenged version without\nproducing the same racial effects. Noting that race and\nparty affiliation in North Carolina were “highly corre-\nlated,” id., at 243, we laid down this rule:\n    “In a case such as this one . . . , the party attacking\n    the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the\n    least that the legislature could have achieved its legit-\n    imate political objectives in alternative ways that are\n    comparably consistent with traditional districting\n    principles. That party must also show that those dis-\n    tricting alternatives would have brought about signif-\n    icantly greater racial balance. Appellees failed to\n    make any such showing here.” Id., at 258.\n  Now, District 12 is back before us. After the 2010 cen-\nsus, the North Carolina Legislature, with the Republicans\nin the majority, drew the present version of District 12.\nThe challengers contend that this version violates equal\nprotection because the predominant motive of the legisla-\nture was racial: to pack the district with African-American\nvoters. The legislature responds that its objective was\npolitical: to pack the district with Democrats and thus to\nincrease the chances of Republican candidates in neigh-\nboring districts.\n  You might think that the Cromartie II rule would be\nequally applicable in this case, which does not differ in\nany relevant particular, but the majority executes a stun-\nning about-face. Now, the challengers’ failure to produce\nan alternative map that meets the Cromartie II test is\ninconsequential. It simply “does not matter.” Ante, at 30.\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U.

The failure\nto produce an alternative map doomed the challengers in\nCromartie II, and the same should be true now. Partisan\ngerrymandering is always unsavory, but that is not the\nissue here. The issue is whether District 12 was drawn\npredominantly because of race.

Partisan gerrymandering dates\nback to the founding, see Vieth, supra, at 274–276 (plural-\nity opinion), and while some might find it distasteful, “[o]ur\nprior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may\nengage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if\nit so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be\nblack Democrats and even if the State were conscious of\nthat fact.” Cromartie I, supra, at 551 (emphasis in origi-\nnal); Vera, supra, at 964 (plurality opinion).\n   The second factor is that “racial identification is highly\ncorrelated with political affiliation” in many jurisdictions.\nCromartie II, 532 U.

Id., at 239–241. Our review for clear error in\nthat case did not exhibit the same diffidence as today’s\ndecision. We carefully examined each piece of direct and\ncircumstantial evidence on which the District Court had\nrelied and conceded that this evidence provided support\nfor the court’s finding. Id., at 257. Then, at the end of our\nopinion, we stated:\n      “We can put the matter more generally as follows:\n    In a case such as this one where majority-minority\n    districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue\n    and where racial identification correlates highly with\n    political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively\n    drawn boundaries must show at the least that the\n    legislature could have achieved its legitimate political\n    objectives in alternative ways that are comparably\n    consistent with traditional districting principles.\n    That party must also show that those districting al-\n    ternatives would have brought about significantly\n    greater racial balance.” Id., at 258.\nBecause the plaintiffs had “failed to make any such show-\ning,” we held that the District Court had clearly erred in\nfinding that race predominated in drawing District 12.\nIbid.\n   Cromartie II plainly meant to establish a rule for use in\na broad class of cases and not a rule to be employed one\ntime only. We stated that we were “put[ting] the matter\nmore generally” and were describing what must be shown\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nin cases “where majority-minority districts (or the approx-\nimate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identifica-\ntion correlates highly with political affiliation.” Ibid. We\nidentified who would carry the burden of the new rule\n(“the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries”)\nand what that party must show (that “the legislature\ncould have achieved its legitimate political objectives in\nalternative ways that are comparably consistent with\ntraditional districting principles” while achieving “signifi-\ncantly greater racial balance”). Ibid. And we reversed the\nfinding of racial predominance due to the plaintiffs’ failure\nto carry the burden established by this evidentiary rule.\nIbid.\n   Here, too, the plaintiffs failed to carry that burden. In\nthis case, as in Cromartie II, the plaintiffs allege a racial\ngerrymander, and the State’s defense is that political\nmotives explain District 12’s boundaries. In such a case,\nCromartie II instructed, plaintiffs must submit an alterna-\ntive redistricting map demonstrating that the legislature\ncould have achieved its political goals without the racial\neffects giving rise to the racial gerrymandering allegation.\nBut in spite of this instruction, plaintiffs in this case failed\nto submit such a map.4 See Brief for Appellees 31–36.\nBased on what we said in Cromartie II about the same type\nof claim involving the same congressional district, reversal\nshould be a foregone conclusion. It turns out, however,\nthat the Cromartie II rule was good for one use only. Even\nin a case involving the very same district, it is tossed\naside.\n\n\n——————\n  4 The challengers’ failure to do so is especially glaring given that at\n\nleast two alternative maps were introduced during the legislative\ndebates over the 2011 map, see 2 Record 357–366, 402–411; App. 883–\n887, though neither party contends that those maps met the legisla-\nture’s political goals.\n\f8                     COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The alternative-map requirement deserves better. It is\na logical response to the difficult problem of distinguishing\nbetween racial and political motivations when race and\npolitical party preference closely correlate.\n   This is a problem with serious institutional and federal-\nism implications. When a federal court says that race was\na legislature’s predominant purpose in drawing a district,\nit accuses the legislature of “offensive and demeaning”\nconduct. Miller, 515 U. S., at 912. Indeed, we have said\nthat racial gerrymanders “bea[r] an uncomfortable re-\nsemblance to political apartheid.” Shaw I, 509 U. S.,\nat 647. That is a grave accusation to level against a state\nlegislature.\n   In addition, “[f]ederal-court review of districting legisla-\ntion represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of\nlocal functions” because “[i]t is well settled that reappor-\ntionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the\nState.” Miller, supra, at 915 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Cromartie II, 532 U. S., at 242. When a\nfederal court finds that race predominated in the redis-\ntricting process, it inserts itself into that process. That is\nappropriate—indeed, constitutionally required—if the\nlegislature truly did draw district boundaries on the basis\nof race. But if a court mistakes a political gerrymander for\na racial gerrymander, it illegitimately invades a traditional\ndomain of state authority, usurping the role of a State’s\nelected representatives. This does violence to both the\nproper role of the Judiciary and the powers reserved to the\nStates under the Constitution.\n   There is a final, often-unstated danger where race and\npolitics correlate: that the federal courts will be trans-\nformed into weapons of political warfare. Unless courts\n“exercise extraordinary caution” in distinguishing race-\nbased redistricting from politics-based redistricting, Mil-\nler, supra, at 916, they will invite the losers in the redis-\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

If the majority party\ndraws districts to favor itself, the minority party can deny\nthe majority its political victory by prevailing on a racial\ngerrymandering claim. Even if the minority party loses in\ncourt, it can exact a heavy price by using the judicial\nprocess to engage in political trench warfare for years on\nend.\n   Although I do not imply that this is what occurred here,\nthis case does reflect what litigation of this sort can look\nlike. This is the fifth time that North Carolina’s 12th\nCongressional District has come before this Court since\n1993, and we have almost reached a new redistricting\ncycle without any certainty as to the constitutionality of\nNorth Carolina’s current redistricting map. Given these\ndangers, Cromartie II was justified in crafting an eviden-\ntiary rule to prevent false positives.5\n                             C\n   The majority nevertheless absolves the challengers of\ntheir failure to submit an alternative map. It argues that\nan alternative map cannot be “the only means” of proving\nracial predominance, and it concludes from this that an\nalternative map “does not matter in this case.” Ante, at\n29–30 (emphasis in original). But even if there are cases\nin which a plaintiff could prove a racial gerrymandering\nclaim without an alternative map, they would be excep-\ntional ones in which the evidence of racial predominance is\n\n——————\n  5 Ignoring all of these well-founded reasons supporting the alternative-\nmap requirement, the majority mischaracterizes my argument as, at\nbottom, resting on the proposition that “little is lost by making suits\nlike this one as hard as possible.” Ante, at 31, n. 15. That is not my\nview, and it is richly ironic for the Court that announced the alternative-\nmap requirement to accuse those who defend the requirement of erecting\nillegitimate and unnecessary barriers to the vindication of constitu-\ntional rights.\n\f10                       COOPER v.

This most definitely is not one of those\ncases, see Part III–C, infra, and the plaintiffs’ failure to\nproduce an alternative map mandates reversal. Moreover,\neven in an exceptional case, the absence of such a map\nwould still be strong evidence that a district’s boundaries\nwere determined by politics rather than race.6 The ab-\nsence of a map would “matter.” Cf. ante, at 30.\n   The majority questions the legitimacy of the alternative-\nmap requirement, ante, at 29–31, and n. 15, but the rule is\na sound one. It rests on familiar principles regarding the\nallocation of the burdens of production and persuasion and\nthe assessment of evidence. First, in accordance with the\ngeneral rule in civil cases, plaintiffs in a case like this bear\nthe burden of proving that the legislature’s motive was\nunconstitutional. Second, what must be shown is not\nsimply that race played a part in the districting process\nbut that it played the predominant role. Third, a party\nchallenging a districting plan must overcome the strong\npresumption that the plan was drawn for constitutionally\npermissible reasons. Miller, supra, at 915. Fourth, when\nthose responsible for adopting a challenged plan contend\nthat the plan was devised for partisan political ends, they\nare making an admission that may not sit well with vot-\ners, so the explanation should not be lightly dismissed. Cf.\nFed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3). And finally, the Cromartie II\nrule takes into account the difficulty of proving a negative.\n   For challengers like those in the present case, producing\na map that meets the Cromartie II test should not be hard\nif the predominant reason for a challenged plan really was\nrace and not politics.

Today, an expert with a computer\ncan easily churn out redistricting maps that control for\nany number of specified criteria, including prior voting\npatterns and political party registration. Therefore, if it is\nindeed possible to find a map that meets the Cromartie II\ntest, it should not be too hard for the challengers to do so.\nThe State, on the other hand, cannot prove that no map\nmeeting the Cromartie II test can be drawn. Even if a\nState submits, say, 100 alternative maps that fail the test,\nthat would not prove that no such map could pass it. The\nrelative ease with which the opposing parties can gather\nevidence is a familiar consideration in allocating the bur-\nden of production. See 1 C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick,\nFederal Evidence §63, p. 316 (2d ed. 1994); 21 C. Wright &\nK.

The State offered strong and coherent evidence\nthat politics, not race, was the legislature’s predominant\naim, and the evidence supporting the District Court’s\ncontrary finding is weak and manifestly inadequate in\nlight of the high evidentiary standard that our cases\nrequire challengers to meet in order to prove racial\npredominance.7\n——————\n   7 The majority accuses me of failing to accord proper deference to the\n\nDistrict Court’s factual findings and of disregarding the clear-error\nstandard of review, ante, at 20, n. 8, but that is nonsense. Unlike the\nmajority, I simply follow Cromartie II by evaluating the District Court’s\nfindings in light of the plaintiffs’ burden. See 532 U.

First, I will\ndiscuss what the legislature’s mapmaker did and why this\napproach is entirely consistent with his stated political\nobjectives. Then, I will explain why this approach inevita-\nbly had the racial effect to which the challengers object.\nFinally, I will address the evidence of racial predominance\non which the majority relies and show why it is inade-\nquate to sustain the District Court’s judgment.\n                             A\n   In order to understand the mapmaker’s approach, the\nfirst element to be kept in mind is that the basic shape of\nDistrict 12 was legitimately taken as a given. When a new\ncensus requires redistricting, it is a common practice to\nstart with the plan used in the prior map and to change\nthe boundaries of the prior districts only as needed to\ncomply with the one-person, one-vote mandate and to\nachieve other desired ends. This approach honors settled\nexpectations and, if the prior plan survived legal chal-\nlenge, minimizes the risk that the new plan will be over-\nturned. And that is the approach taken by the veteran\nmapmaker in the present case, Dr. Thomas Hofeller. App.\n523 (“the normal starting point is always from the existing\ndistricts”).\n   Dr. Hofeller began with the prior version of District 12\n——————\nbe clearly erroneous to find that they have.

Given that the State has offered a coherent and persuasive\npolitical explanation for District 12’s boundaries, plaintiffs bear a\n“demanding” burden in attempting to prove racial predominance.\nCromartie II, supra, at 241, 257. Because the evidence they have put\nforward is so weak, see Part III–C, infra, they have failed to carry that\nburden, and it was clear error for the District Court to hold otherwise.\nSee Cromartie II, supra, at 241, 257 (applying the same clear-error\nanalysis that I apply here).\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

That design has\na long history. It was first adopted in 1992, and subse-\nquent redistricting plans have built on the 1992 plan.\nIbid. In Cromartie II, we sustained the constitutionality\nof the 1997 version of District 12, which featured the same\nbasic shape. See 532 U. S., at 258. And retention of this\nsame basic shape is not challenged in this case.8\n   Using the prior design as his starting point, Dr. Hofeller\nassumed that District 12 would remain a “strong Demo-\ncratic distric[t].” App. 521. He stated that he drew “the\n[overall redistricting] plan to . . . have an increased num-\nber of competitive districts for GOP candidates,” id., at\n520, and that he therefore moved more Democratic voters\ninto District 12 in order to “increase Republican opportu-\nnities in the surrounding districts,” id., at 1606.\n   Under the map now before us, District 12 is bordered by\nfour districts.9 Running counterclockwise, they are: Dis-\ntrict 5 to the northwest; District 9 to the southwest; Dis-\ntrict 8 to the southeast; and District 6 to the northeast.\nSee Appendix, ante. According to Dr. Hofeller, the aim\nwas to make these four districts—considered as a whole—\nmore secure for Republicans. App. 1606, 2696.\n   To do this, Dr. Hofeller set out in search of pockets of\nDemocratic voters that could be moved into District 12\nfrom areas adjoining or very close to District 12’s prior\nboundaries. Of the six counties through which District 12\npasses, the three most heavily Democratic (and also the\nmost populous) are Forsyth, Guilford, and Mecklenburg,\nwhich contain the major population centers of Winston-\nSalem, Greensboro, and Charlotte, respectively. See 7\n——————\n   8 This same basic shape was retained in the map proposed in the\n\nstate legislature by the Democratic leadership and in the map submit-\nted by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. See 2 Record 402, 357.\n   9 A fifth district, District 2, appears to touch District 12 at the border\n\nof Guilford and Randolph Counties, but only to a de minimis extent.\n\f14                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nRecord 480–482; App. 1141. As a measure of voting pref-\nerences, Dr. Hofeller used the results of the then-most\nrecent Presidential election, i.e., the election of 2008. Id.,\nat 1149, 2697, 2721–2722. In that election, these three\ncounties voted strongly for the Democratic candidate,\nthen-Senator Barack Obama, while the other three coun-\nties, Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan, all voted for the\nRepublican candidate, Senator John McCain. See 4 Rec-\nord 1341–1342.\n   Two of the three Democratic counties, Forsyth and\nGuilford, are located at the northern end of District 12,\nwhile the other Democratic county, Mecklenburg, is on the\nsouthern end. See Appendix, ante. The middle of the\ndistrict (often called the “corridor”) passes through the\nthree more Republican-friendly counties—Cabarrus,\nDavidson, and Rowan. Ibid. Thus, if a mapmaker sat\ndown to increase the proportion of Democrats in District\n12 and to reduce the proportion in neighboring districts,\nthe most obvious way to do that was to pull additional\nDemocrats into the district from the north and south (the\nmost populous and heavily Democratic counties) while\nshifting Republican voters out of the corridor.\n   That, in essence, is what Dr. Hofeller did—as the major-\nity acknowledges. Ante, at 6 (Dr. Hofeller “narrow[ed\nDistrict 12’s] already snakelike body while adding areas at\neither end”); App. 1150 (Table 1), 1163. Dr. Hofeller testi-\nfied that he sought to shift parts of Mecklenburg County\nout of Districts 8 and 9 (in order to reduce the percentage\nof Democrats in these two districts) and that this required\nhim to increase the coverage of Mecklenburg County in\nDistrict 12. Id., at 1142–1143, 1607, 2753.\n   Dr. Hofeller testified that he also had political plans for\nthe current map’s District 6, which differed substantially\nfrom the version in the prior map.

App. 523. Parts of\nDavidson and Rowan Counties were therefore shifted to\nDistrict 5, id., at 1143, 1150 (Table 1), but Dr. Hofeller\ntestified that this would not have been sufficient to satisfy\nthe one-person, one-vote standard, so he also had to move\nvoters from heavily Democratic Forsyth County into Dis-\ntrict 5, id., at 1143, 2697, 2752–2753. Doing so did not\nundermine his political objective, he explained, because\nDistrict 5 “was stronger [for Republicans] to begin with\nand could take those [Forsyth] Democratic precincts”\nwithout endangering Republican chances in the district.\nId., at 2753; see also id., at 2697. The end result was that,\nunder the new map now at issue, the three major counties\nin the north and south constitute a larger percentage of\nDistrict 12’s total population, while the corridor lost popu-\nlation. See id., at 1150 (Table 1), 2149 (Finding 187).\n   A comparison of the 2008 Presidential election vote\nunder the old and new versions of the districts shows the\neffect of Dr. Hofeller’s map. District 8 (which, of the four\ndistricts bordering District 12 under the 2011 map, was\nthe most Democratic district) saw a drop of almost 11% in\nthe Democratic vote under the new map. See 2 Record\n354, 421. District 9 saw a drop in the percentage of regis-\ntered Democrats, id., at 350, 417, although the vote per-\ncentage for the Democratic Presidential candidate re-\n——————\n  10 District 12 was overpopulated by 2,847 people heading into the\n\n2011 redistricting cycle.

District 5, which was heavily Republican under\nthe prior map and was redrawn to absorb Democrats from\nForsyth County, saw about a 7-point swing in favor of the\nDemocratic candidate, but it remained a strong Republi-\ncan district. Ibid. New District 6 is less susceptible to\ncomparison because its boundaries are completely differ-\nent from the district bearing that number under the old\nplan, but the new District 6 was solidly Republican, with a\nRepublican Presidential vote percentage of nearly 56%.\nIbid. As stated by the state court that considered and\nrejected the same constitutional challenge now before us:\n       “By increasing the number of Democratic voters in\n     the 2011 Twelfth Congressional District located in\n     Mecklenburg and Guilford Counties, the 2011 Con-\n     gressional Plan created other districts that were more\n     competitive for Republican candidates as compared to\n     the 2001 versions of these districts . . . .” App. 2150\n     (Finding 191).\n  The results of subsequent congressional elections show\nthat Dr. Hofeller’s plan achieved its goal. In 2010, prior to\nthe adoption of the current plan, Democrats won 7 of the\n13 districts, including District 8.11 But by 2016, Republi-\ncans controlled 10 of the 13 districts, including District 8,\nand all the Republican candidates for the House of Repre-\nsentatives won their races with at least 56% of the vote.12\nIn accordance with the map’s design, the only Democratic\nseats remaining after 2016 were in Districts 1, 4, and 12.\nId., at 521.\n——————\n  11 North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11/02/2010 Official Gen-\n\neral Election Results—Statewide, http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=\n11/02/2010&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\n  12 North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11/08/2016 Official Gen-\n\neral Election Results—Statewide, http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=\n11/08/2016&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\n\f                    Cite as: 581 U.

App. 2022 (state trial court finding that “racial\nidentification correlates highly with political affiliation” in\nNorth Carolina). The challenger’s expert, Dr. Stephen\nAnsolabehere, corroborated this important point. Dr.\nAnsolabehere calculated the statewide correlation between\nrace and voting in 200813 and found a correlation of 0.8,\nwhich is “very high.” Id., at 342, 352 (Table 1). See also J.\nLevin, J. Fox, & D. Forde, Elementary Statistics in Social\nResearch 370 (12th ed. 2014); R. Witte & J.

In 2008, the Democratic\ncandidate for President was then-Senator Barack Obama, the first\nblack major party Presidential nominee, and it is true that President\nObama won a higher percentage of the nationwide African-American\nvote in 2008 (95%) than did the Democratic Presidential candidates in\n2000 (90%), 2004 (88%), and 2016 (88%). See supra, at 5, n. 3. But as\nthese figures show, the correlation between race and political party\npreference was very high in all these elections. Therefore, the use of\n2008 statistics does not appear to have substantially affected the\nanalysis.\n\f18                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nDemocrats in the area covered by the district. Under the\n2001 version of District 12—which was drawn by Demo-\ncrats and was never challenged as a racial gerrymander—\nblack registered voters constituted 71.44% of Democrats in\nthe district. 2 Record 350; see also App. 2145 (Finding\n173).14 What this means is that a mapmaker seeking to\npull Democrats into District 12 would unavoidably pull in\na very large percentage of African-Americans.\n  The distribution of Democratic voters magnified this\neffect. Dr. Hofeller’s plan required the identification of\nareas of Democratic strength that were near District 12’s\nprior boundaries. Dr. Hofeller prepared maps showing the\ndistribution of Democratic voters by precinct,15 see id., at\n1148–1149, 1176–1177, 1181, and those maps show that\nthese voters were highly concentrated around the major\nurban areas of Winston-Salem (in Forsyth County),\nGreensboro (in Guilford County), and Charlotte (in Meck-\nlenberg County). Dr. Ansolabehere, the challengers’ ex-\npert, prepared maps showing the distribution of black\nregistered voters in these same counties, see id., at 322–\n328; 1 Record 128–133, and a comparison of these two sets\nof maps reveals that the clusters of Democratic voters\ngenerally overlap with those of registered black voters. In\nother words, the population of nearby Democrats who\ncould be moved into District 12 was heavily black.\n  The upshot is that, so long as the legislature chose to\n——————\n  14 Even  two alternative redistricting plans offered prior to the enact-\nment of the 2011 map—one submitted by the Southern Coalition for\nSocial Justice and the other submitted by Democratic leaders in the\nstate legislature—retained the basic shape of District 12 and resulted\nin black voters constituting 71.53% and 69.14% of registered Demo-\ncrats, respectively. 2 Record 361 (Southern Coalition for Social Justice\nmap), 406 (Congressional Fair and Legal map); see also App. 883–887,\n2071 (Finding 34), 2145 (Finding 173).\n   15 To minimize jargon, I will use the term “precincts” to refer to vote\n\ntabulation districts (VTDs).

After all, when\nthe basic shape of District 12 was created after the 1990\ncensus, the express goal of the North Carolina Legislature\nwas to create a majority-minority district. See Shaw I,\n509 U. S., at 633–636. It has its unusual shape because it\nwas originally designed to capture pockets of black voters.\nSee Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 905–906 (1996) (Shaw\nII). Although the legislature has modified the district\nsince then, see Cromartie I, 526 U. S., at 544 (describing\nchanges from the 1991 version to the 1997 version), “it\nretains its basic ‘snakelike’ shape and continues to track\nInterstate 85.” Ibid.; 1 Record 35 (Appellees’ Complaint)\n(“Congressional District 12 has existed in roughly its\ncurrent form since 1992, when it was drawn as a majority\nAfrican-American district . . . ”); see also App. 1163 (show-\ning the 1997, 2001, and 2011 versions of District 12). The\noriginal design of the district was devised to ensure a high\nconcentration of black voters, and as long as the basic\ndesign is retained (as it has been), one would expect that\nto continue.\n   While plaintiffs failed to offer any alternative map, Dr.\nHofeller produced a map showing what District 12 would\nhave looked like if his computer was programmed simply\nto maximize the Democratic vote percentage in the dis-\ntrict, while still abiding by the requirement of one-person,\none-vote. Id., at 1148. The result was a version of District\n12 that is very similar to the version approved by the\nNorth Carolina Legislature. See id., at 1175; id., at 1615–\n1618. Indeed, this maximum-Democratic plan had a black\nvoting age population of 50.73%, which is actually higher\nthan District 12’s black voting age population of 50.66%.\nId., at 1154 (Table 5).\n\f20                        COOPER v.

Cromartie II, 532 U. S., at\n245 (“[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic\nprecincts within a district without regard to race, end up\nwith a district containing more heavily African-American\nprecincts, but the reasons would be political rather than\nracial”).\n   Amazingly, a reader of the majority opinion (and the\nopinion of the District Court) would remain almost entirely\nignorant of the legislature’s political strategy and the\nrelationship between that strategy and the racial composi-\ntion of District 12.16 The majority’s analysis is like Ham-\nlet without the prince.17\n                             C\n   The majority focuses almost all its attention on a few\nreferences to race by those responsible for the drafting and\nadoption of the redistricting plan. But the majority reads\nfar too much into these references. First, what the plain-\ntiffs had to prove was not simply that race played some\nrole in the districting process but that it was the legisla-\n——————\n   16 The District Court’s description of the legislature’s political strat-\n\negy was cursory, and it spent no time analyzing the demographics of the\nregion.

It\noffers no excuse for its failure to meaningfully describe—much less\nengage with—the State’s political explanation for District 12’s bounda-\nries. Instead, it tries to change the subject, accusing me of treating the\nState’s account as essentially uncontested. Ante, at 19, n. 6. This is a\nhollow accusation. In this opinion, I lay out the evidence supporting\nthe State’s political explanation in Parts III–A and III–B, but I do not\naccept that account at face value.

If a State ultimately concludes that it must\ntake race into account in order to comply with the Voting\nRights Act, it must show that it had a “ ‘strong basis in\nevidence’ in support of the (race-based) choice that it has\nmade.” Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 22). But those involved in the redistricting\nprocess may legitimately make statements about Voting\nRights Act compliance before deciding that the Act does\nnot provide a need for race-based districting. And it is\nunderstandable for such individuals to explain that a race-\nneutral plan happens to satisfy the criteria on which\nVoting Rights Act challengers might insist. In short,\nbecause of the Voting Rights Act, consideration and dis-\ncussion of the racial effects of a plan may be expected.\n                              1\n                The June 17, 2011, Statement\n   I begin with a piece of evidence that the majority does\nnot mention, namely, the very first item cited by the Dis-\ntrict Court in support of its racial-predominance finding.\nThis evidence consisted of a June 17, 2001, statement by\nSenator Rucho and Representative Lewis, the state legis-\nlators who took the lead in the adoption of the current\nmap. In that statement, Rucho and Lewis referred to\n“constructing [Voting Rights Act] majority black districts.”\nApp. 1025. Seizing upon the use of the plural term “dis-\ntricts,” the court below seemed to think that it had found a\nsmoking gun. Harris v.

Brief for United States 27,\nn. 13. The majority, by contrast, tries to ignore this error.\nBut the District Court gave the June 17 statement pride-\nof-place in its opinion, mentioning it first in its analysis,\nand the District Court seemed to think that this evidence\nwas particularly significant, stating that the reference to\nmultiple districts was not “the result of happenstance, a\nmere slip of the pen.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Dis-\ntrict Court’s error shows a troubling lack of precision.\n                             2\n                The §5 Preclearance Request\n   Under §5 of the Voting Rights Act, North Carolina\nrequested preclearance from the Department of Justice\nshortly after the Legislature approved the new congres-\nsional plan. Id., at 608. In its preclearance application,\nthe State noted that “[o]ne of the concerns of the Redis-\ntricting Chairs was that in 1992, the Justice Department\nhad objected to the 1991 Congressional Plan because of a\nfailure by the State to create a second majority minority\ndistrict.” App. 478. The application says that the Redis-\ntricting Chairs “sought input from Congressman [Mel]\nWatt[, the African-American incumbent who represented\nDistrict 12,] regarding options for re-drawing his district,”\nand that after this consultation, “the Chairs had the im-\npression that Congressman Watt would oppose any re-\ndrawing of the Twelfth District . . . as originally contem-\nplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.” Ibid.\n\f24                  COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nThe Chairs drew District 12 “[b]ased in part on this input\nfrom Congressman Watt.” Id., at 478–479. Two sentences\nlater in the same paragraph, the application observed that\nthe black voting age population for District 12 went up\nfrom 43.77% to 50.66% and that therefore the district\n“maintains, and in fact increases, the African-American\ncommunity’s ability to elect their candidate of choice in\nDistrict 12.” Id., at 479.\n   According to the majority, this statement shows a “de-\ntermination to concentrate black voters in District 12.”\nAnte, at 23. In fact, it shows no such thing. The state-\nment explains that Senator Rucho and Representative\nLewis decided not to construct District 12 as a majority-\nminority district—as the 1992 Justice Department had\ndemanded—“[b]ased in part on” the input they received\nfrom Congressman Watt, whom they thought “would\noppose” drawing the district “as originally contemplated\nby the 1992 Justice Department objection.” App. 478–479.\nIf anything, this document cuts against a finding of racial\npredominance.\n   The statement’s matter-of-fact reference to the increase\nin District 12’s black voting age population hardly shows\nthat the legislature altered District 12 for the purpose of\ncausing this increase. An entirely natural interpretation\nis that the Redistricting Chairs simply reported this fact\nso that it would be before the Justice Department in the\nevent that the Department had renewed Voting Rights Act\nconcerns. Only by reading a great deal between the lines\nand adopting the most sinister possible interpretation can\nthe statement be viewed as pointed evidence of a predomi-\nnantly racial motive.\n                          3\n               The Mel Watt Testimony\n  In both the District Court and the state trial court,\nCongressman Watt testified that, while the redistricting\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U.

Id.,\nat 2368–2369, 1343–1344. According to Congressman\nWatt, Senator Rucho said that the Republican leadership\nwanted him to “ramp the 12th Congressional District up to\nover 50 percent black” because “they believed it was re-\nquired . . . by the Voting Rights Act.” Id., at 1344, 2369,\n2393. In the state proceedings, Senator Rucho denied\nmaking any such statement, id., at 1703, and another\nstate legislator present at the meeting, Representative\nRuth Samuelson, gave similar testimony, id., at 1698.\nNeither Senator Rucho nor Representative Samuelson\ntestified in federal court (although their state court testi-\nmony was made part of the federal record). See id., at\n2847. But the District Court credited Congressman Watt’s\ntestimony based on its assessment of his demeanor and\nthe consistency of his recollection, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See App. 1345 (state trial court evidentiary ruling).\nFor unknown reasons, Appellants failed to raise this objection below,\nbut that only means that the testimony was admitted. The weight of\nthat testimony is a different matter, and in general, hearsay should be\nviewed with great skepticism. Ellicott v.

App. 478–479.\n   This account is fully consistent with Congressman\nWatt’s testimony about his meeting with Senator Rucho.\nCongressman Watt noted that Senator Rucho was uncom-\nfortable with the notion of increasing the black voting age\npopulation, id., at 2369, 2393, and Congressman Watt\ntestified that he told Senator Rucho that he was opposed\nto the idea, id., at 1345, 2369, 2393. So it makes sense\nthat Senator Rucho was dissuaded from taking that course\nby Congressman Watt’s reaction. And Dr. Hofeller con-\nsistently testified that he was never asked to meet a par-\nticular black voting age population target, see Part III–C–\n5, infra, and that the only data displayed on his screen\nwhen he drew District 12 was political data. See infra, at\n27, n. 19. Thus, Congressman Watt’s testimony, even if\ntaken at face value, is entirely consistent with what the\npreclearance request recounts: After initially contemplat-\ning the possibility of drawing District 12 as a majority-\nminority district, the legislative leadership met with\nCongressman Watt, who convinced them not to do so.\n                           4\n    Dr. Hofeller’s Statements About Guilford County\n Under the prior map, both Guilford County and the\nGreensboro African-American community were divided\n\f                       Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                 27\n\n                            Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nbetween the 12th and 13th Districts. This had been done,\nDr. Hofeller explained, “to make both the Old 12th and\n13th Districts strongly Democratic.” App. 1103; see also\nid., at 555, 2821; 1 Record 132–133 (showing racial de-\nmographics of Guilford precincts under 2001 and 2011\nmaps). But the Republican legislature wanted to make\nthe area surrounding District 12 more Republican. The\nnew map eliminated the old 13th District and created a\nnew district bearing that number farther to the east. The\nterritory to the north of Greensboro that had previously\nbeen in the 13th District was placed in a new district,\nDistrict 6, which was constructed to be a Republican-\nfriendly district, and the new map moved more of the\nGreensboro area into the new District 12. This move was\nentirely consistent with the legislature’s stated goal of\nconcentrating Democrats in the 12th District and mak-\ning the surrounding districts hospitable to Republican\ncandidates.\n   Dr. Hofeller testified that the placement of the Greens-\nboro African-American community in the 12th District\nwas the result of this political strategy. He stated that the\nportion of Guilford County absorbed by District 12 “wasn’t\nmoved into CD 12 because it had a substantial black\npopulation. It was moved into CD 12 because it had a\nsubstantial Democratic political voting record . . . .” App.\n2824. And Dr. Hofeller maintained that he was never\ninstructed to draw District 12 as a majority-minority\ndistrict or to increase the district’s black voting age popu-\nlation. See, e.g., id., at 520, 556–558, 1099, 1603–1604,\n2682–2683, 2789. Instead, he testified that political con-\nsiderations determined the boundaries of District 12 and\nthat the only data displayed on his computer screen when\nhe drew the challenged map was voting data from the\n2008 Presidential election.19 Id., at 1149, 2697, 2721–\n——————\n 19 Significantly,   while the District Court doubted Dr. Hofeller’s con-\n\f28                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n2722.\n    Dr. Hofeller acknowledged, however, that there had\nbeen concern about the possibility of a Voting Rights Act\nchallenge to this treatment of the Greensboro African-\nAmerican community. Guilford County was covered by §5\nof the Voting Rights Act, and as noted, §5 prohibits retro-\ngression. Under the old map, the Guilford County African-\nAmerican community was split between the old District 13\nand District 12, and in both of those districts, black voters\nwere able to elect the candidates of their choice by allying\nwith white Democratic voters. Under the new map, how-\never, if the Greensboro black community had been split\nbetween District 12 and the new Republican-friendly\nDistrict 6, the black voters in the latter district would be\nunlikely to elect the candidate of their choice. Placing the\nAfrican-American community in District 12 avoided this\nconsequence. Even Congressman Watt conceded that\nthere were potential §5 concerns relating to the black\ncommunity in Guilford County. Id., at 2387–2388.\n    The thrust of many of Dr. Hofeller’s statements about\nthe treatment of Guilford County was that the reuniting of\nthe Greensboro black community in District 12 was noth-\ning more than a welcome byproduct of his political strat-\negy. He testified that he first drew the district based on\npolitical considerations and then checked to ensure that\nGuilford County’s black population was not fractured. Id.,\nat 2822 (“[W]hen we checked it, we found that we did not\nhave an issue in Guilford County with fracturing the black\n. . . community”); see also id., at 556, 2821, 2823. This\ntestimony is entirely innocuous.\n——————\ntention that politics, not race, dictated the boundaries of District 12 and\nthat Dr. Hofeller was unaware of the relevant racial demographics in\nthe region, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 619–620, and n. 8, it did not dispute\nthat only political data was displayed on his screen when he drew the\ndistrict. The state trial court expressly found that only political data\nwas displayed on Dr. Hofeller’s screen. See App. 2150 (Finding 188).\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           29\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Hofeller also made\na few statements that may be read to imply that concern\nabout Voting Rights Act litigation was part of the motiva-\ntion for the treatment of Guilford County. He testified at\ntrial that he “was instructed [not] to use race in any form\nexcept perhaps with regard to Guilford County.” Id., at\n2791 (emphasis added). See id., at 1103 (the legislature\n“determined that it was prudent to reunify the African-\nAmerican community in Guilford County”); id., at 558\n(“[I]t was decided to reunite the black community in Guil-\nford County into the Twelfth”).\n   These statements by Dr. Hofeller convinced the District\nCourt that the drawing of District 12 was not a “purely . . .\npolitically driven affair.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 619. But in\norder to prevail, the plaintiffs had to show much more—\nthat race was the predominant reason for the drawing of\nDistrict 12, and these few bits of testimony fall far short of\nthat showing.\n   Our decision in Cromartie II illustrates this point. In\nthat case, the legislature’s mapmaker made a statement\nthat is remarkably similar to Dr. Hofeller’s. Gerry Cohen,\nthe “legislative staff member responsible for drafting\ndistricting plans,” reported: “ ‘I have moved Greensboro\nBlack community into the 12th, and now need to take\n[about] 60,000 out of the 12th. I await your direction on\nthis.’ ” 532 U. S., at 254. This admission did not persuade\nthe Court that the legislature’s predominant motive was\nracial. The majority ignores this obvious parallel with\nCromartie II.\n   Moreover, in an attempt to magnify the importance of\nthe treatment of Guilford County, the majority plays\ngames with statistics. It states that “District 12 saw a net\nincrease of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford\nCounty, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across\nthe district: So the newly added parts of that county\nplayed a major role in pushing the district’s BVAP over\n\f30                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n50%.” Ante, at 26.\n   This is highly misleading. First, since the black voting\nage population of District 12 is just barely over 50%—\nspecifically, 50.66%—almost any decision that increased\nthe number of voting age blacks in District 12 could be\nsaid to have “played a major role in pushing the district’s\nBVAP over 50%.”\n   Second, the majority provides the total number of voting\nage blacks added to District 12 from Guilford County\n(approximately 25,000) alongside the total number of\nvoting age blacks added to the district (approximately\n35,000), and this has the effect of making Guilford County\nlook like it is the overwhelming contributor to the dis-\ntrict’s net increase in black voting age population. In\ntruth, Mecklenburg County was by far the greatest con-\ntributor of voting age blacks to District 12 in both absolute\nterms (approximately 147,000) and in terms of new voting\nage blacks (approximately 37,000). See App. 384, 500–\n502. Indeed, if what matters to the majority is how much\nindividual counties increased District 12’s black voting age\npopulation percentage, Davidson County deserves atten-\ntion as well, since the portion of the county within District\n12 lost over 26,000 more voting age whites than blacks.\nIbid. That is greater than the net number of voting age\nblacks added to the district by Guilford County or Meck-\nlenburg County. Ibid. As with so much in the majority\nopinion, the issue here is more nuanced—and much more\nfavorable to the State—than the majority would have it\nseem.\n                             5\n               The July 1, 2011, Statement\n  For reasons similar to those just explained, the majority\nmakes far too much of a statement issued by Senator\nRucho and Representative Lewis on July 1, 2011, when\nthe new districting plan was proposed. Particularly in\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)          31\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nlight of Dr. Hofeller’s later testimony about the legisla-\nture’s partisan objectives, it is apparent that this state-\nment does not paint an entirely reliable picture of the\nlegislature’s aims. The statement begins with this proc-\nlamation: “From the beginning, our goal has remained the\nsame: the development of fair and legal congressional and\nlegislative districts,” id., at 353, and the statement seri-\nously downplays the role of politics in the map-drawing\nprocess, acknowledging only that “we have not been igno-\nrant of the partisan impacts of the districts we have\ncreated,” id., at 361.\n   The statement discusses the treatment of Guilford\nCounty in a section with the heading “Compliance with\nthe Voting Rights Act.” Id., at 355–358. In that section,\nRucho and Lewis state: “Because of the presence of Guil-\nford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our\nproposed Twelfth District at a black voting age level that\nis above the percentage of black voting age population\nfound in the current Twelfth District. We believe that this\nmeasure will ensure preclearance of the plan.” Id., at 358.\n   The majority and the District Court interpret this pas-\nsage to say that Rucho and Lewis decided to move black\nvoters from Guilford County into District 12 in order to\nward off Voting Rights Act liability. Ante, at 22 (“Because\nof the VRA, [Rucho and Lewis] increased the number of\nAfrican-Americans” in District 12 (citing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat 617; emphasis in original)). But that is hardly the only\nplausible interpretation. The statement could just as\neasily be understood as “an explanation by [the] legisla-\nture that because they chose to add Guilford County back\ninto CD 12, the district ended up with an increased ability\nto elect African-American candidates, rather than the\nlegislature explaining that they chose to add Guilford\nCounty back into CD 12 because of the [racial] results that\naddition created.” Id., at 635 (Osteen, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original). And\n\f32                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nbecause we are obligated to presume the good faith of the\nNorth Carolina Legislature, this latter interpretation is\nthe appropriate one.\n   But even if one adopts the majority’s interpretation, it\nadds little to the analysis. The majority’s close and in-\ncriminating reading of a statement issued to win public\nsupport for the new plan may represent poetic justice:\nHaving attempted to blur the partisan aim of the new\nDistrict 12, the legislature is hoisted on its own petard.\nBut poetic justice is not the type of justice that we are\nsupposed to dispense. This statement is some evidence\nthat race played a role in the drawing of District 12, but it\nis a mistake to give this political statement too much\nweight.\n   Again, we made precisely this point in Cromartie II.\nThere, the “legislative redistricting leader,” then-Senator\nRoy Cooper, testified before a legislative committee that\nthe proposed plan “ ‘provides for . . . racial and partisan\nbalance.’ ” 532 U. S., at 253 (emphasis added). The Dis-\ntrict Court read the statement literally and concluded that\nthe district had been drawn with a racial objective.

But that would be\ntrue only if black and white voters were evenly distributed\nthroughout the region, and his own maps showed that this\nwas not so. See id., at 322–328; 1 Record 128–133. Black\nvoters were concentrated in the cities located at the north\nand south ends of the district and constituted a superma-\njority of Democrats in the area covered by District 12. See\nPart III–B, supra. As long as the basic shape of the dis-\ntrict was retained, moving Democrats from areas outside\nbut close to the old district boundaries naturally picked up\nfar more black Democrats than white Democrats.\n   This explanation eluded Dr. Ansolabehere because he\nrefused to consider either the implications of the political\nstrategy that the legislature claimed to have pursued or\nthe effects of the changes to District 12 on the surrounding\ndistricts.

When a State\n  invokes the VRA to justify race-based districting, it must show (to\n  meet the “narrow tailoring” requirement) that it had “good reasons”\n  for concluding that the statute required its action. Alabama Legisla-\n  tive Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U. S. ___, ___. A district court’s\n  factual findings made in the course of this two-step inquiry are re-\n  viewed only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6); Easley\n  v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 242 (Cromartie II).\n     This case concerns North Carolina’s redrawing of two congressional\n  districts, District 1 and District 12, after the 2010 census. Prior to\n  that redistricting, neither district had a majority black voting-age\n  population (BVAP), but both consistently elected the candidates pre-\n  ferred by most African-American voters. The new map significantly\n  altered both District 1 and District 12. The State needed to add al-\n\f2                         COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n most 100,000 people to District 1 to comply with the one-person-one-\n vote principle, and it chose to take most of those people from heavily\n black areas of Durham—increasing the district’s BVAP from 48.6% to\n 52.7%. The State also reconfigured District 12, increasing its BVAP\n from 43.8% to 50.7%. Registered voters in those districts (here called\n “the plaintiffs”) filed suit against North Carolina officials (collective-\n ly, “the State” or “North Carolina”), complaining of impermissible ra-\n cial gerrymanders. A three-judge District Court held both districts\n unconstitutional. It found that racial considerations predominated in\n the drawing of District 1’s lines and rejected the State’s claim that\n this action was justified by the VRA. As for District 12, the court\n again found that race predominated, and it explained that the State\n made no attempt to justify its attention to race in designing that dis-\n trict.\nHeld:\n    1. North Carolina’s victory in a similar state-court lawsuit does not\n dictate the disposition of this case or alter the applicable standard of\n review. Before this case was filed, a state trial court rejected a claim\n by several civil rights groups that Districts 1 and 12 were unlawful\n racial gerrymanders. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed\n that decision under the state-court equivalent of clear error review.\n The State claims that the plaintiffs are members of the same organi-\n zations that brought the earlier case, and thus precluded from raising\n the same questions anew. But the State never satisfied the District\n Court that the alleged affiliation really existed. And because the Dis-\n trict Court’s factual finding was reasonable, it defeats North Caroli-\n na’s attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.\n    The State’s backup argument about the proper standard of review\n also falls short. The rule that a trial court’s factual findings are re-\n viewed only for clear error contains no exception for findings that di-\n verge from those made in another court. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n 52(a)(6). Although the state court’s decision is certainly relevant, the\n premise of clear error review is that there are often “two permissible\n views of the evidence.” Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564,\n 574. Even assuming that the state court’s findings capture one such\n view, the only question here is whether the District Court’s assess-\n ment represents another. Pp. 7–10.\n    2. The District Court did not err in concluding that race furnished\n the predominant rationale for District 1’s redesign and that the\n State’s interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that con-\n sideration of race. Pp. 10–18.\n       (a) The record shows that the State purposefully established a\n racial target for the district and that the target “had a direct and sig-\n nificant impact” on the district’s configuration, Alabama, 575 U. S.,\n\f                    Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nat ___, subordinating other districting criteria. Faced with this body\nof evidence, the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race\npredominated in drawing District 1; indeed, it could hardly have con-\ncluded anything but. Pp. 10–12.\n     (b) North Carolina’s use of race as the predominant factor in de-\nsigning District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny. The State ar-\ngues that it had good reasons to believe that it had to draw a majori-\nty-minority district to avoid liability for vote dilution under §2 of the\nVRA. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, identifies three threshold\nconditions for proving such a vote-dilution claim: (1) A “minority\ngroup” must be “sufficiently large and geographically compact to con-\nstitute a majority” in some reasonably configured legislative district,\nid., at 50; (2) the minority group must be “politically cohesive,” id., at\n51; and (3) a district’s white majority must “vote[ ] sufficiently as a\nbloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s preferred candidate,” ibid. If a\nState has good reason to think that all three of these conditions are\nmet, then so too it has good reason to believe that §2 requires draw-\ning a majority-minority district. But if not, then not.\n   Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a §2 plaintiff\ncould demonstrate the third Gingles prerequisite. For nearly 20\nyears before the new plan’s adoption, African-Americans made up\nless than a majority of District 1’s voters, but their preferred candi-\ndates scored consistent victories. District 1 thus functioned as a\n“crossover” district, in which members of the majority help a “large\nenough” minority to elect its candidate of choice. Bartlett v. Strick-\nland, 556 U. S. 1, 13 (plurality opinion). So experience gave the State\nno reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1’s\nBVAP.\n   The State counters that because it needed to substantially increase\nDistrict 1’s population, the question facing the state mapmakers was\nnot whether the then-existing District 1 violated §2, but whether the\nfuture District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race. But\nthat reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify the State’s race-based re-\ndesign of the district. Most important, the State points to no mean-\ningful legislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies: whether a\nnew, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race, could lead\nto §2 liability. To have a strong basis to conclude that §2 demands\nrace-based measures to augment a district’s BVAP, the State must\nevaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the Gingles preconditions\nin a new district created without those measures. Nothing in the leg-\nislative record here fits that description. And that is no accident:\nThe redistricters believed that this Court’s decision in Strickland\nmandated a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1. They apparently reasoned\nthat if, as Strickland held, §2 does not require crossover districts (for\n\f4                           COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    groups insufficiently large under Gingles), then §2 also cannot be sat-\n    isfied by crossover districts (for groups meeting Gingles’ size condi-\n    tion). But, as this Court’s §2 jurisprudence makes clear, unless each\n    of the three Gingles prerequisites is established, “there neither has\n    been a wrong nor can be a remedy.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25,\n    41. North Carolina’s belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1\n    (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district thus\n    rested on a pure error of law. Accordingly, the Court upholds the\n    District Court’s conclusion that the State’s use of race as the predom-\n    inant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.\n    Pp. 12–18.\n       3. The District Court also did not clearly err by finding that race\n    predominated in the redrawing of District 12. Pp. 18–34.\n             (a) The district’s legality turns solely on which of two possible\n    reasons predominantly explains its reconfiguration. The plaintiffs\n    contended at trial that North Carolina intentionally increased Dis-\n    trict 12’s BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under §5 of the\n    VRA. According to the State, by contrast, the mapmakers moved\n    voters in and out of the district as part of a “strictly” political gerry-\n    mander, without regard to race. After hearing evidence supporting\n    both parties’ accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs’.\n       Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special chal-\n    lenges for a trial court, which must make “ ‘a sensitive inquiry’ ” into\n    all “ ‘circumstantial and direct evidence of intent’ ” to assess whether\n    the plaintiffs have proved that race, not politics, drove a district’s\n    lines. Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U. S. 541, 546 (Cromartie I). This\n    Court’s job is different—and generally easier. It affirms a trial\n    court’s factual finding as to racial predominance so long as the find-\n    ing is “plausible”; it reverses only when “left with the definite and\n    firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470\n    U. S., at 573–574. In assessing a finding’s plausibility, moreover, the\n    Court gives singular deference to a trial court’s judgments about the\n    credibility of witnesses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). Applying\n    those principles here, the evidence at trial—including live witness\n    testimony subject to credibility determinations—adequately supports\n    the District Court’s conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for\n    District 12’s reconfiguration. And contrary to the State’s view, the\n    court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs\n    did not proffer an alternative design for District 12. Pp. 18–21.\n             (b) By slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its\n    snakelike body, North Carolina added 35,000 African-Americans and\n    subtracted 50,000 whites, turning District 12 into a majority-\n    minority district.

S. ____ (2017)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npreparing the revamped plan—publicly stated that racial considera-\ntions lay behind District 12’s augmented BVAP. Specifically, Rucho\nand Lewis explained that because part of Guilford County, a jurisdic-\ntion covered by §5 of the VRA, lay in the district, they had increased\nthe district’s BVAP to ensure preclearance of the plan. Dr. Thomas\nHofeller, their hired mapmaker, confirmed that intent. The State’s\npreclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a simi-\nlar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12. And, in\ntestimony that the District Court found credible, Congressman Mel\nWatt testified that Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to him\nin 2011. Hofeller testified that he had drawn District 12’s lines based\non political data, and that he checked the racial data only after he\ndrew a politics-based line between adjacent areas in Guilford County.\nBut the District Court disbelieved Hofeller’s asserted indifference to\nthe new district’s racial composition, pointing to his contrary deposi-\ntion testimony and a significant contradiction in his trial testimony.\nFinally, an expert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs’\ncase, showing that, regardless of party, a black voter in the region\nwas three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot\nwithin District 12’s borders.\n   The District Court’s assessment that all this evidence proved racial\npredominance clears the bar of clear error review. Maybe this Court\nwould have evaluated the testimony differently had it presided over\nthe trial; or then again, maybe it would not have. Either way, the\nCourt is far from having a “definite and firm conviction” that the Dis-\ntrict Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it\nthat racial considerations predominated in District 12’s design.\nPp. 21–28.\n       (c) Finally, North Carolina argues that when race and politics\nare competing explanations of a district’s lines, plaintiffs must intro-\nduce an alternative map that achieves a State’s asserted political\ngoals while improving racial balance. Such a map can serve as key\nevidence in a race-versus-politics dispute, but it is hardly the only\nmeans to disprove a State’s contention that politics drove a district’s\nlines. In this case, the plaintiffs’ introduction of mostly direct and\nsome circumstantial evidence gave the District Court a sufficient ba-\nsis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question. Although a\nplaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical mat-\nter, to make his case, such a map is merely an evidentiary tool to\nshow that an equal protection violation has occurred; neither its\npresence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering\nclaim.\n   North Carolina claims that a passage of this Court’s opinion in\nCromartie II makes an alternative map essential in cases like this\n\f6                           COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    one, but the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading. The\n    Court’s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categori-\n    cal rule that the State claims to find there, and the entire thrust of\n    the opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.\n    Rightly understood, the passage on which the State relies had a dif-\n    ferent and narrower point: Given the weak evidence of a racial ger-\n    rymander offered in Cromartie II, only maps that would actually\n    show what the plaintiffs’ had not could carry the day. This case, in\n    contrast, turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally con-\n    structed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly’s\n    intent in creating the actual District 12—including many hours of\n    trial testimony subject to credibility determinations. That evidence,\n    the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs’ bur-\n    den of debunking North Carolina’s politics defense. Pp. 28–34.\n159 F.

But it also imposes an im-\nportant constraint: A State may not use race as the pre-\ndominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a\ncompelling reason. In this case, a three-judge District\nCourt ruled that North Carolina officials violated that bar\nwhen they created two districts whose voting-age popula-\ntions were majority black. Applying a deferential stand-\nard of review to the factual findings underlying that\ndecision, we affirm.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment limits racial gerrymanders in legislative districting\nplans. It prevents a State, in the absence of “sufficient\njustification,” from “separating its citizens into different\nvoting districts on the basis of race.” Bethune-Hill v.\nVirginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.

When a voter sues state officials for drawing\nsuch race-based lines, our decisions call for a two-step\nanalysis.\n  First, the plaintiff must prove that “race was the pre-\ndominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to\nplace a significant number of voters within or without a\nparticular district.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916\n(1995). That entails demonstrating that the legislature\n“subordinated” other factors—compactness, respect for\npolitical subdivisions, partisan advantage, what have\nyou—to “racial considerations.” Ibid. The plaintiff may\nmake the required showing through “direct evidence” of\nlegislative intent, “circumstantial evidence of a district’s\nshape and demographics,” or a mix of both. Ibid.1\n  Second, if racial considerations predominated over\nothers, the design of the district must withstand strict\nscrutiny. See Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at\n13). The burden thus shifts to the State to prove that its\nrace-based sorting of voters serves a “compelling interest”\nand is “narrowly tailored” to that end. Ibid.

Before this Court invalidated its\ncoverage formula, see Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.

United States,\n425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976).\n   When a State invokes the VRA to justify race-based\ndistricting, it must show (to meet the “narrow tailoring”\nrequirement) that it had “a strong basis in evidence” for\nconcluding that the statute required its action.

Or said otherwise, the State must\nestablish that it had “good reasons” to think that it would\ntransgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district\nlines. Ibid. That “strong basis” (or “good reasons”) stand-\nard gives States “breathing room” to adopt reasonable\ncompliance measures that may prove, in perfect hindsight,\nnot to have been needed. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.

But the court’s findings of\nfact—most notably, as to whether racial considerations\npredominated in drawing district lines—are subject to\nreview only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n52(a)(6); Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 242 (2001)\n(Cromartie II); id., at 259 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Under\nthat standard, we may not reverse just because we “would\nhave decided the [matter] differently.” Anderson v. Bes­\nsemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 573 (1985). A finding that is\n“plausible” in light of the full record—even if another is\nequally or more so—must govern. Id., at 574.\n                             B\n  This case concerns North Carolina’s most recent redraw-\ning of two congressional districts, both of which have long\nincluded substantial populations of black voters. In its\ncurrent incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the north-\neastern part of the State, with appendages stretching both\nsouth and west (the latter into Durham). District 12\nbegins in the south-central part of the State (where it\ntakes in a large part of Charlotte) and then travels north-\neast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State’s northern\nborder. (Maps showing the districts are included in an\nappendix to this opinion.) Both have quite the history\nbefore this Court.\n  We first encountered the two districts, in their 1992\nversions, in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993). There, we\nheld that voters stated an equal protection claim by alleg-\ning that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial ger-\nrymanders. See id., at 642, 649. After a remand to the\nDistrict Court, the case arrived back at our door. See\nShaw II, 517 U. S. 899. That time, we dismissed the\nchallenge to District 1 for lack of standing, but struck\ndown District 12. The design of that “serpentine” district,\nwe held, was nothing if not race-centric, and could not be\njustified as a reasonable attempt to comply with the VRA.\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 906; see id., at 911–918.\n  The next year, the State responded with a new district-\ning plan, including a new District 12—and residents of\nthat district brought another lawsuit alleging an imper-\nmissible racial gerrymander. A District Court sustained\nthe claim twice, but both times this Court reversed. See\nHunt v. Cromartie, 526 U. S. 541 (1999) (Cromartie I );\nCromartie II, 532 U. S. 234. Racial considerations, we\nheld, did not predominate in designing the revised District\n12. Rather, that district was the result of a political ger-\nrymander—an effort to engineer, mostly “without regard\nto race,” a safe Democratic seat. Id., at 245.\n  The State redrew its congressional districts again in\n2001, to account for population changes revealed in the\nprior year’s census. Under the 2001 map, which went\nunchallenged in court, neither District 1 nor District 12\nhad a black voting-age population (called a “BVAP”) that\nwas a majority of the whole: The former had a BVAP of\naround 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%. See App.\n312, 503. Nonetheless, in five successive general elections\nconducted in those reconfigured districts, all the candi-\ndates preferred by most African-American voters won\ntheir contests—and by some handy margins. In District 1,\nblack voters’ candidates of choice garnered as much as\n70% of the total vote, and never less than 59%. See 5\nRecord 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls. Exh. 112). And in\nDistrict 12, those candidates won with 72% of the vote at\nthe high end and 64% at the low. See id., at 637, 640, 643,\n646, 650.\n  Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet another con-\ngressional map—(finally) the one at issue in this case.\nState Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative\nDavid Lewis, both Republicans, chaired the two commit-\ntees jointly responsible for preparing the revamped plan.\nThey hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a veteran political map-\nmaker, to assist them in redrawing district lines. Several\n\f6                     COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhearings, drafts, and revisions later, both chambers of the\nState’s General Assembly adopted the scheme the three\nmen proposed.\n   The new map (among other things) significantly altered\nboth District 1 and District 12. The 2010 census had\nrevealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To\ncomply with the Constitution’s one-person-one-vote prin-\nciple, the State needed to place almost 100,000 new people\nwithin the district’s boundaries. See App. 2690; Evenwel\nv. Abbott, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3) (explain-\ning that “[s]tates must draw congressional districts with\npopulations as close to perfect equality as possible”).\nRucho, Lewis, and Hofeller chose to take most of those\npeople from heavily black areas of Durham, requiring a\nfinger-like extension of the district’s western line. See\nAppendix, infra. With that addition, District 1’s BVAP\nrose from 48.6% to 52.7%. See App. 312–313. District 12,\nfor its part, had no need for significant total-population\nchanges: It was overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people\nout of over 730,000. See id., at 1150. Still, Rucho, Lewis,\nand Hofeller decided to reconfigure the district, further\nnarrowing its already snakelike body while adding areas\nat either end—most relevantly here, in Guilford County.\nSee Appendix, infra; App. 1164. Those changes apprecia-\nbly shifted the racial composition of District 12: As the\ndistrict gained some 35,000 African-Americans of voting\nage and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP\nincreased from 43.8% to 50.7%. See 2 Record 349 (Fourth\nAffidavit of Dan Frey, Exh. 5); id., at 416 (Exh. 11).\n   Registered voters in the two districts (David Harris and\nChristine Bowser, here called “the plaintiffs”) brought this\nsuit against North Carolina officials (collectively, “the\nState” or “North Carolina”), complaining of impermissible\nracial gerrymanders. After a bench trial, a three-judge\nDistrict Court held both districts unconstitutional. All the\njudges agreed that racial considerations predominated in\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe design of District 1. See Harris v. McCrory, 159\nF. Supp. 3d 600, 611 (MDNC 2016). And in then applying\nstrict scrutiny, all rejected the State’s argument that it\nhad a “strong basis” for thinking that the VRA compelled\nsuch a race-based drawing of District 1’s lines. Id., at 623.\nAs for District 12, a majority of the panel held that “race\npredominated” over all other factors, including partisan-\nship. Id., at 622. And the court explained that the State\nhad failed to put forward any reason, compelling or other-\nwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.\nSee ibid. Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that\nrace, rather than politics, drove District 12’s lines—yet\nstill characterized the majority’s view as “[e]minently\nreasonable.” Id., at 640.\n  The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted probable\njurisdiction. McCrory v. Harris, 579 U. S. ___ (2016).\n                               II\n   We address at the outset North Carolina’s contention\nthat a victory it won in a very similar state-court lawsuit\nshould dictate (or at least influence) our disposition of this\ncase. As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP\nand several other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1\nand 12 in state court immediately after their enactment,\ncharging that they were unlawful racial gerrymanders.\nSee Brief for Appellants 19–20. By the time the plaintiffs\nbefore us filed this action, the state trial court, in Dickson\nv. Rucho, had rejected those claims—finding that in Dis-\ntrict 1 the VRA justified the General Assembly’s use of\nrace and that in District 12 race was not a factor at all.\nSee App. 1969. The North Carolina Supreme Court then\naffirmed that decision by a 4–3 vote, applying the state-\ncourt equivalent of clear error review. See Dickson v.\nRucho, 368 N. C. 481, 500, 781 S. E. 2d 404, 419 (2015),\nmodified on denial of reh’g, 368 N. C. 673, 789 S. E. 2d 436\n(2016), cert. pending, No. 16–24. In this Court, North\n\f8                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCarolina makes two related arguments based on the Dick­\nson litigation: first, that the state trial court’s judgment\nshould have barred this case altogether, under familiar\nprinciples of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that\nthe state court’s conclusions should cause us to conduct a\n“searching review” of the decision below, rather than\ndeferring (as usual) to its factual findings. Reply Brief 6.\n   The State’s preclusion theory rests on an assertion\nabout how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated. As\nthe State acknowledges, one person’s lawsuit generally\ndoes not bar another’s, no matter how similar they are in\nsubstance. See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 892–893\n(2008) (noting the “deep-rooted historic tradition that\neveryone should have his own day in court”). But when\nplaintiffs in two cases have a special relationship, a judg-\nment against one can indeed bind both. See id., at 893–\n895 (describing six categories of qualifying relationships).\nThe State contends that Harris and Bowser, the plaintiffs\nhere, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs in\nDickson. And according to North Carolina, that connec-\ntion prevents the pair from raising anew the questions\nthat the state court previously resolved against those\ngroups. See Brief for Appellants 20–21.\n   But North Carolina never satisfied the District Court\nthat the alleged affiliation really existed. When the State\nargued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary\njudgment, Harris and Bowser responded that they were\nnot members of any of the organizations that had brought\nthe Dickson suit. See 3 Record 1577–1582 (Defs. Motion\nfor Summary Judgment); 4 Record 101–106 (Pls. Opposi-\ntion to Motion for Summary Judgment). The parties’\ndueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those\ngroups’ membership policies (e.g., could Harris’s payment\nof dues to the national NAACP, or Bowser’s financial\ncontribution to the Mecklenburg County NAACP, have\nmade either a member of the state branch?). Because of\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthose unresolved “factual disputes,” the District Court\ndenied North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment. 4\nRecord 238 (July 29, 2014 Order). And nothing in the\nsubsequent trial supported the State’s assertion about\nHarris’s and Bowser’s organizational ties: Indeed, the\nState chose not to present any further evidence relating to\nthe membership issue. Based on the resulting record, the\nDistrict Court summarily rejected the State’s claim that\nHarris and Bowser were something other than independ-\nent plaintiffs. See 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 609.\n    That conclusion defeats North Carolina’s attempt to\nargue for claim or issue preclusion here. We have no basis\nfor assessing the factual assertions underlying the State’s\nargument any differently than the District Court did.\nNothing in the State’s evidence clearly rebuts Harris’s and\nBowser’s testimony that they never joined any of the\nDickson groups. We need not decide whether the alleged\nmemberships would have supported preclusion if they had\nbeen proved. It is enough that the District Court reason-\nably thought they had not.\n    The State’s back-up argument about our standard of\nreview also falls short. The rule that we review a trial\ncourt’s factual findings for clear error contains no excep-\ntion for findings that diverge from those made in another\ncourt. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6) (“Findings of fact\n. . . must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous”); see\nalso Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 369 (1991)\n(plurality opinion) (applying the same standard to a state\ncourt’s findings). Whatever findings are under review\nreceive the benefit of deference, without regard to whether\na court in a separate suit has seen the matter differently.\nSo here, we must ask not which court considering Districts\n1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply\nwhether the court below’s view is clearly wrong. That\ndoes not mean the state court’s decision is wholly irrele-\nvant: It is common sense that, all else equal, a finding is\n\f10                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore likely to be plainly wrong if some judges disagree\nwith it. Cf. Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip\nop., at 17) (noting that we are even less likely to disturb a\nfactual determination when “multiple trial courts have\nreached the same finding”). But the very premise of clear\nerror review is that there are often “two permissible”—\nbecause two “plausible”—“views of the evidence.” Ander­\nson, 470 U. S., at 574; see supra, at 4. Even assuming the\nstate court’s findings capture one such view, the District\nCourt’s assessment may yet represent another. And the\npermissibility of the District Court’s account is the only\nquestion before us.\n                             III\n   With that out of the way, we turn to the merits of this\ncase, beginning (appropriately enough) with District 1. As\nnoted above, the court below found that race furnished the\npredominant rationale for that district’s redesign. See\nsupra, at 6–7. And it held that the State’s interest in\ncomplying with the VRA could not justify that considera-\ntion of race. See supra, at 7. We uphold both conclusions.\n                             A\n   Uncontested evidence in the record shows that the\nState’s mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully\nestablished a racial target: African-Americans should\nmake up no less than a majority of the voting-age popula-\ntion. See 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 611–614. Senator Rucho and\nRepresentative Lewis were not coy in expressing that goal.\nThey repeatedly told their colleagues that District 1 had to\nbe majority-minority, so as to comply with the VRA.\nDuring a Senate debate, for example, Rucho explained\nthat District 1 “must include a sufficient number of\nAfrican-Americans” to make it “a majority black district.”\nApp. 689–690. Similarly, Lewis informed the House and\nSenate redistricting committees that the district must\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave “a majority black voting age population.” Id., at 610.\nAnd that objective was communicated in no uncertain\nterms to the legislators’ consultant. Dr. Hofeller testified\nmultiple times at trial that Rucho and Lewis instructed\nhim “to draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50\npercent.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 613; see, e.g., ibid. (“Once\nagain, my instructions [were] that the district had to be\ndrawn at above 50 percent”).\n  Hofeller followed those directions to the letter, such that\nthe 50%-plus racial target “had a direct and significant\nimpact” on District 1’s configuration. Alabama, 575 U. S.,\nat __ (slip op., at 17). In particular, Hofeller moved the\ndistrict’s borders to encompass the heavily black parts of\nDurham (and only those parts), thus taking in tens of\nthousands of additional African-American voters. That\nchange and similar ones, made (in his words) to ensure\nthat the district’s racial composition would “add[ ] up\ncorrectly,” deviated from the districting practices he other-\nwise would have followed. App. 2802. Hofeller candidly\nadmitted that point: For example, he testified, he some-\ntimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he\nwished because “the more important thing” was to create a\nmajority-minority district. Id., at 2807; see id., at 2809.\nThe result is a district with stark racial borders: Within\nthe same counties, the portions that fall inside District 1\nhave black populations two to three times larger than the\nportions placed in neighboring districts. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 19; cf. Alabama, 575\nU. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18) (relying on similar\nevidence to find racial predominance).\n  Faced with this body of evidence—showing an an-\nnounced racial target that subordinated other districting\ncriteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions\nbetween blacks and whites—the District Court did not\nclearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing\nDistrict 1. Indeed, as all three judges recognized, the\n\f12                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt could hardly have concluded anything but. See 159\nF. Supp. 3d, at 611 (calling District 1 a “textbook example”\nof race-based districting).3\n                               B\n  The more substantial question is whether District 1 can\nsurvive the strict scrutiny applied to racial gerrymanders.\nAs noted earlier, we have long assumed that complying\nwith the VRA is a compelling interest. See supra, at 2.\nAnd we have held that race-based districting is narrowly\ntailored to that objective if a State had “good reasons” for\nthinking that the Act demanded such steps. See supra, at\n3. North Carolina argues that District 1 passes muster\nunder that standard: The General Assembly (so says the\nState) had “good reasons to believe it needed to draw\n[District 1] as a majority-minority district to avoid Section\n2 liability” for vote dilution. Brief for Appellants 52. We\nnow turn to that defense.\n  This Court identified, in Thornburg v. Gingles, three\nthreshold conditions for proving vote dilution under §2 of\nthe VRA. See 478 U. S., at 50–51. First, a “minority\ngroup” must be “sufficiently large and geographically\n——————\n   3 The State’s argument to the contrary rests on a legal proposition\n\nthat was foreclosed almost as soon as it was raised in this Court.\nAccording to the State, racial considerations cannot predominate in\ndrawing district lines unless there is an “actual conflict” between those\nlines and “traditional districting principles.” Brief for Appellants 45.\nBut we rejected that view earlier this Term, holding that when (as\nhere) race furnished “the overriding reason for choosing one map over\nothers,” a further showing of “inconsistency between the enacted plan\nand traditional redistricting criteria” is unnecessary to a finding of\nracial predominance. Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections,\n580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10). And in any event, the evi-\ndence recounted in the text indicates that District 1’s boundaries did\nconflict with traditional districting principles—for example, by splitting\nnumerous counties and precincts. See supra, at 11. So we would\nuphold the District Court’s finding of racial predominance even under\nthe (incorrect) legal standard the State proposes.\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompact to constitute a majority” in some reasonably\nconfigured legislative district. Id., at 50. Second, the\nminority group must be “politically cohesive.” Id., at 51.\nAnd third, a district’s white majority must “vote[ ] suffi-\nciently as a bloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s pre-\nferred candidate.” Ibid. Those three showings, we have\nexplained, are needed to establish that “the minority\n[group] has the potential to elect a representative of its\nown choice” in a possible district, but that racially polar-\nized voting prevents it from doing so in the district as\nactually drawn because it is “submerg[ed] in a larger\nwhite voting population.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25,\n40 (1993). If a State has good reason to think that all the\n“Gingles preconditions” are met, then so too it has good\nreason to believe that §2 requires drawing a majority-\nminority district. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 978\n(1996) (plurality opinion). But if not, then not.\n   Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a §2\nplaintiff could demonstrate the third Gingles prerequi-\nsite—effective white bloc-voting.4 For most of the twenty\nyears prior to the new plan’s adoption, African-Americans\nhad made up less than a majority of District 1’s voters; the\ndistrict’s BVAP usually hovered between 46% and 48%.\nSee 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 606; App. 312. Yet throughout\nthose two decades, as the District Court noted, District 1\nwas “an extraordinarily safe district for African-American\npreferred candidates.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 626. In the\nclosest election during that period, African-Americans’\n——————\n  4 Inthe District Court, the parties also presented arguments relating\nto the first Gingles prerequisite, contesting whether the African-\nAmerican community in the region was sufficiently large and compact\nto form a majority of a reasonably shaped district. The court chose not\nto decide that fact-intensive question. And aside from the State’s\nunelaborated assertion that “[t]here is no question that the first factor\nwas satisfied,” Brief for Appellants 52, the parties have not briefed or\nargued the issue before us. We therefore have no occasion to address it.\n\f14                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncandidate of choice received 59% of the total vote; in other\nyears, the share of the vote garnered by those candidates\nrose to as much as 70%. See supra, at 5. Those victories\n(indeed, landslides) occurred because the district’s white\npopulation did not “vote[ ] sufficiently as a bloc” to thwart\nblack voters’ preference, Gingles, 478 U. S., at 51; rather, a\nmeaningful number of white voters joined a politically\ncohesive black community to elect that group’s favored\ncandidate. In the lingo of voting law, District 1 func-\ntioned, election year in and election year out, as a “cross-\nover” district, in which members of the majority help a\n“large enough” minority to elect its candidate of choice.\nBartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13 (2009) (plurality\nopinion). When voters act in that way, “[i]t is difficult to\nsee how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be\nmet”—and hence how §2 liability could be established. Id.,\nat 16. So experience gave the State no reason to think\nthat the VRA required it to ramp up District 1’s BVAP.\n   The State counters that, in this context, past perfor-\nmance is no guarantee of future results. See Brief for\nAppellants 57–58; Reply Brief 19–20. Recall here that the\nState had to redraw its whole congressional map following\nthe 2010 census. See supra, at 5. And in particular, the\nState had to add nearly 100,000 new people to District 1 to\nmeet the one-person-one-vote standard. See supra, at 6.\nThat meant about 13% of the voters in the new district\nwould never have voted there before. See App. 2690;\nReply Brief 20. So, North Carolina contends, the question\nfacing the state mapmakers was not whether the then-\nexisting District 1 violated §2. Rather, the question was\nwhether the future District 1 would do so if drawn without\nregard to race. And that issue, the State claims, could not\nbe resolved by “focusing myopically on past elections.” Id.,\nat 19.\n   But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify North\nCarolina’s race-based redesign of District 1. True enough,\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\na legislature undertaking a redistricting must assess\nwhether the new districts it contemplates (not the old ones\nit sheds) conform to the VRA’s requirements. And true\ntoo, an inescapable influx of additional voters into a dis-\ntrict may suggest the possibility that its former track\nrecord of compliance can continue only if the legislature\nintentionally adjusts its racial composition. Still, North\nCarolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime\npattern of white crossover voting in the area that would\nform the core of the redrawn District 1. See Gingles, 478\nU. S., at 57 (noting that longtime voting patterns are\nhighly probative of racial polarization). And even more\nimportant, North Carolina can point to no meaningful\nlegislative inquiry into what it now rightly identifies as\nthe key issue: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created\nwithout a focus on race but however else the State would\nchoose, could lead to §2 liability. The prospect of a signifi-\ncant population increase in a district only raises—it does\nnot answer—the question whether §2 requires deliberate\nmeasures to augment the district’s BVAP. (Indeed, such\npopulation growth could cut in either direction, depending\non who comes into the district.) To have a strong basis in\nevidence to conclude that §2 demands such race-based\nsteps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a plain-\ntiff could establish the Gingles preconditions—including\neffective white bloc-voting—in a new district created\nwithout those measures. We see nothing in the legislative\nrecord that fits that description.5\n——————\n  5 North  Carolina calls our attention to two expert reports on voting\npatterns throughout the State, but neither casts light on the relevant\nissue. The first (by Dr. Thomas Brunell) showed that some elections in\nmany of the State’s counties exhibited “statistically significant” racially\npolarized voting. App. 1001. The second (by Dr. Ray Block) found that\nin various elections across the State, white voters were “noticeably” less\nlikely than black voters to support black candidates. Id., at 959. From\nthose far-flung data points—themselves based only on past elections—\n\f16                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  And that absence is no accident: Rucho and Lewis pro-\nceeded under a wholly different theory—arising not from\nGingles but from Bartlett v. Strickland—of what §2 de-\nmanded in drawing District 1. Strickland involved a\ngeographic area in which African-Americans could not\nform a majority of a reasonably compact district. See 556\nU. S., at 8 (plurality opinion). The African-American\ncommunity, however, was sizable enough to enable the\nformation of a crossover district, in which a substantial\nbloc of black voters, if receiving help from some white\nones, could elect the candidates of their choice. See supra,\nat 14. A plurality of this Court, invoking the first Gingles\nprecondition, held that §2 did not require creating that\ndistrict: When a minority group is not sufficiently large to\nmake up a majority in a reasonably shaped district, §2\nsimply does not apply. See 556 U. S., at 18–20. Over and\nover in the legislative record, Rucho and Lewis cited\nStrickland as mandating a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.\nSee App. 355–356, 363–364, 472–474, 609–610, 619, 1044.\nThey apparently reasoned that if, as Strickland held, §2\ndoes not require crossover districts (for groups insufficiently\nlarge under Gingles), then §2 also cannot be satisfied by\ncrossover districts (for groups in fact meeting Gingles’ size\ncondition). In effect, they concluded, whenever a legisla-\nture can draw a majority-minority district, it must do so—\neven if a crossover district would also allow the minority\n——————\nthe experts opined (to no one’s great surprise) that in North Carolina,\nas in most States, there are discernible, non-random relationships\nbetween race and voting. But as the District Court found, see Harris v.\nMcCrory, 159 F. Supp. 3d 600, 624 (MDNC 2016), that generalized\nconclusion fails to meaningfully (or indeed, at all) address the relevant\nlocal question: whether, in a new version of District 1 created without a\nfocus on race, black voters would encounter “sufficient[ ]” white bloc-\nvoting to “cancel [their] ability to elect representatives of their choice,”\nGingles, 478 U. S., at 56. And so the reports do not answer whether the\nlegislature needed to boost District 1’s BVAP to avoid potential §2\nliability.\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngroup to elect its favored candidates. See 1 Tr. 21–22\n(counsel’s explanation that “the [S]tate interpreted”\nStrickland to say that, in order to protect African-\nAmericans’ electoral strength and thus avoid §2 liability,\nthe BVAP in District 1 “need[ed] to be above 50 percent”).\n  That idea, though, is at war with our §2 jurisprudence—\nStrickland included. Under the State’s view, the third\nGingles condition is no condition at all, because even in\nthe absence of effective white bloc-voting, a §2 claim could\nsucceed in a district (like the old District 1) with an under-\n50% BVAP. But this Court has made clear that unless\neach of the three Gingles prerequisites is established,\n“there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.”\nGrowe, 507 U. S., at 41. And Strickland, far from support-\ning North Carolina’s view, underscored the necessity of\ndemonstrating effective white bloc-voting to prevail in a §2\nvote-dilution suit. The plurality explained that “[i]n areas\nwith substantial crossover voting,” §2 plaintiffs would not\n“be able to establish the third Gingles precondition” and so\n“majority-minority districts would not be required.” 556\nU. S., at 24; see also ibid. (noting that States can “defend\nagainst alleged §2 violations by pointing to crossover\nvoting patterns and to effective crossover districts”).\nThus, North Carolina’s belief that it was compelled to\nredraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a\nmajority-minority district rested not on a “strong basis in\nevidence,” but instead on a pure error of law. Alabama,\n575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).\n  In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take race-based\nactions reasonably judged necessary under a proper inter-\npretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District\n1. We by no means “insist that a state legislature, when\nredistricting, determine precisely what percent minority\npopulation [§2 of the VRA] demands.” Ibid. But neither\nwill we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is\nsupported by no evidence and whose raison d’être is a legal\n\f18                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmistake. Accordingly, we uphold the District Court’s\nconclusion that North Carolina’s use of race as the pre-\ndominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand\nstrict scrutiny.\n                              IV\n   We now look west to District 12, making its fifth(!)\nappearance before this Court. This time, the district’s\nlegality turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible\nreasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfigu-\nration. The plaintiffs contended at trial that the General\nAssembly chose voters for District 12, as for District 1,\nbecause of their race; more particularly, they urged that\nthe Assembly intentionally increased District 12’s BVAP\nin the name of ensuring preclearance under the VRA’s §5.\nBut North Carolina declined to mount any defense (simi-\nlar to the one we have just considered for District 1) that\n§5’s requirements in fact justified race-based changes to\nDistrict 12—perhaps because §5 could not reasonably be\nunderstood to have done so, see n. 10, infra. Instead, the\nState altogether denied that racial considerations ac-\ncounted for (or, indeed, played the slightest role in) Dis-\ntrict 12’s redesign. According to the State’s version of\nevents, Senator Rucho, Representative Lewis, and Dr.\nHofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a\n“strictly” political gerrymander, without regard to race. 6\nRecord 1011. The mapmakers drew their lines, in other\nwords, to “pack” District 12 with Democrats, not African-\nAmericans. After hearing evidence supporting both par-\nties’ accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs’.6\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE ALITO charges us with “ignor[ing]” the State’s political-\n\ngerrymander defense, making our analysis “like Hamlet without the\nprince.” Post, at 20 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); see post, at 20, 34. But we simply\ntake the State’s account for what it is: one side of a thoroughly two-\nsided case (and, as we will discuss, the side the District Court rejected,\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                       19\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses\nspecial challenges for a trial court. In the more usual case\nalleging a racial gerrymander—where no one has raised a\npartisanship defense—the court can make real headway\nby exploring the challenged district’s conformity to tradi-\ntional districting principles, such as compactness and\nrespect for county lines. In Shaw II, for example, this\nCourt emphasized the “highly irregular” shape of then-\nDistrict 12 in concluding that race predominated in its\ndesign. 517 U. S., at 905 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). But such evidence loses much of its value when the\nState asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre\nshape—as of the new District 12—can arise from a “politi-\ncal motivation” as well as a racial one. Cromartie I, 526\nU. S., at 547, n. 3. And crucially, political and racial rea-\nsons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district’s\nboundaries. That is because, of course, “racial identifica-\ntion is highly correlated with political affiliation.”\nCromartie II, 532 U. S., at 243. As a result of those redis-\ntricting realities, a trial court has a formidable task: It\nmust make “a sensitive inquiry” into all “circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent” to assess whether the plain-\ntiffs have managed to disentangle race from politics and\n——————\nprimarily on factual grounds). By contrast, the dissent consistently\ntreats the State’s version of events (what it calls “the Legislature’s\npolitical strategy and the relationship between that strategy and\n[District 12’s] racial composition,” post, at 20) as if it were a simple “fact\nof the matter”—the premise of, rather than a contested claim in, this\ncase. See post, at 12–14, 16, 20, 26, 27–29, 33. The dissent’s narrative\nthus tracks, top-to-bottom and point-for-point, the testimony of Dr.\nHofeller, the State’s star witness at trial—so much so that the dissent\ncould just have block-quoted that portion of the transcript and saved\nitself a fair bit of trouble. Compare post, at 12–20, with App. 2671–\n2755. Imagine (to update the dissent’s theatrical reference) Inherit the\nWind retold solely from the perspective of William Jennings Bryan,\nwith nary a thought given to the competing viewpoint of Clarence\nDarrow.\n\f20                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove that the former drove a district’s lines. Cromartie I,\n526 U. S., at 546 (internal quotation marks omitted).7\n   Our job is different—and generally easier. As described\nearlier, we review a district court’s finding as to racial\npredominance only for clear error, except when the court\nmade a legal mistake. See supra, at 3–4. Under that\nstandard of review, we affirm the court’s finding so long as\nit is “plausible”; we reverse only when “left with the defi-\nnite and firm conviction that a mistake has been commit-\nted.” Anderson, 470 U. S., at 573–574; see supra, at 4.\nAnd in deciding which side of that line to come down on,\nwe give singular deference to a trial court’s judgments\nabout the credibility of witnesses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n52(a)(6). That is proper, we have explained, because the\nvarious cues that “bear so heavily on the listener’s under-\nstanding of and belief in what is said” are lost on an appel-\nlate court later sifting through a paper record. Anderson,\n470 U. S., at 575.8\n——————\n  7 As  earlier noted, that inquiry is satisfied when legislators have\n“place[d] a significant number of voters within or without” a district\npredominantly because of their race, regardless of their ultimate\nobjective in taking that step. See supra, at 2, and n. 1. So, for example,\nif legislators use race as their predominant districting criterion with\nthe end goal of advancing their partisan interests—perhaps thinking\nthat a proposed district is more “sellable” as a race-based VRA compli-\nance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish\nmuch the same thing—their action still triggers strict scrutiny. See\nVera, 517 U. S., at 968–970 (plurality opinion). In other words, the\nsorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even if\nrace is meant to function as a proxy for other (including political)\ncharacteristics. See Miller, 515 U. S., at 914.\n   8 Undeterred by these settled principles, the dissent undertakes to\n\nrefind the facts of this case at every turn. See post, at 11–33. Indeed,\nthe dissent repeatedly flips the appropriate standard of review—\narguing, for example, that the District Court’s is not “the only plausible\ninterpretation” of one piece of contested evidence and that the State\noffered an “entirely natural” view of another. Post, at 24, 31; see also\npost, at 20, 26, 27, 33. Underlying that approach to the District Court’s\nfactfinding is an elemental error: The dissent mistakes the rule that a\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In light of those principles, we uphold the District\nCourt’s finding of racial predominance respecting District\n12. The evidence offered at trial, including live witness\ntestimony subject to credibility determinations, adequately\nsupports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted\nfor the district’s reconfiguration. And no error of law\ninfected that judgment: Contrary to North Carolina’s view,\nthe District Court had no call to dismiss this challenge\njust because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative\ndesign for District 12 as circumstantial evidence of the\nlegislature’s intent.\n                               A\n   Begin with some facts and figures, showing how the\nredistricting of District 12 affected its racial composition.\nAs explained above, District 12 (unlike District 1) was\napproximately the right size as it was: North Carolina did\nnot—indeed, could not—much change its total population.\nSee supra, at 6. But by further slimming the district and\nadding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body (including\nin Guilford County), the General Assembly incorporated\ntens of thousands of new voters and pushed out tens of\nthousands of old ones. And those changes followed racial\nlines: To be specific, the new District 12 had 35,000 more\nAfrican-Americans of voting age and 50,000 fewer whites\nof that age. (The difference was made up of voters from\nother racial categories.) See ibid. Those voter exchanges\nproduced a sizable jump in the district’s BVAP, from\n43.8% to 50.7%. See ibid. The Assembly thus turned\nDistrict 12 (as it did District 1, see supra, at 10–11) into a \n\nmajority-minority district.\n\n—————— \n\nlegislature’s good faith should be presumed “until a claimant makes a\nshowing sufficient to support th[e] allegation” of “race-based deci-\nsionmaking,” Miller, 515 U. S., at 915, for a kind of super-charged, pro-\nState presumption on appeal, trumping clear-error review. See post, at\n11–12, n. 7.\n\f22                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   As the plaintiffs pointed out at trial, Rucho and Lewis\nhad publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind\nDistrict 12’s augmented BVAP. In a release issued along\nwith their draft districting plan, the two legislators as-\ncribed that change to the need to achieve preclearance of\nthe plan under §5 of the VRA. See App. 358. At that time,\n§5 covered Guilford County and thus prohibited any “ret-\nrogression in the [electoral] position of racial minorities”\nthere. Beer, 425 U. S., at 141; see 31 Fed. Reg. 5081\n(1966). And part of Guilford County lay within District\n12, which meant that the Department of Justice would\nclosely scrutinize that district’s new lines. In light of those\nfacts, Rucho and Lewis wrote: “Because of the presence of\nGuilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn\nour proposed Twelfth District at a [BVAP] level that is\nabove the percentage of [BVAP] found in the current\nTwelfth District.” App. 358. According to the two legisla-\ntors, that race-based “measure w[ould] ensure preclear-\nance of the plan.” Ibid. Thus, the District Court found,\nRucho’s and Lewis’s own account “evince[d] intentionality”\nas to District 12’s racial composition: Because of the VRA,\nthey increased the number of African-Americans. 159\nF. Supp. 3d, at 617.\n   Hofeller confirmed that intent in both deposition testi-\nmony and an expert report. Before the redistricting,\nHofeller testified, some black residents of Guilford County\nfell within District 12 while others fell within neighboring\nDistrict 13. The legislators, he continued, “decided to\nreunite the black community in Guilford County into the\nTwelfth.” App. 558; see id., at 530–531. Why? Hofeller\nresponded, in language the District Court emphasized:\n“[I]n order to be cautious and draw a plan that would pass\nmuster under the Voting Rights Act.” Id., at 558; see 159\nF. Supp. 3d, at 619. Likewise, Hofeller’s expert report\nhighlighted the role of the VRA in altering District 12’s\nlines. “[M]indful that Guilford County was covered” by §5,\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nHofeller explained, the legislature “determined that it was\nprudent to reunify [the county’s] African-American com-\nmunity” into District 12. App. 1103. That change caused\nthe district’s compactness to decrease (in expert-speak, it\n“lowered the Reock Score”), but that was a sacrifice well\nworth making: It would “avoid the possibility of a [VRA]\ncharge” that would “inhibit[ ] preclearance.” Ibid.\n   The State’s preclearance submission to the Justice\nDepartment indicated a similar determination to concen-\ntrate black voters in District 12. “One of the concerns of\nthe Redistricting Chairs,” North Carolina there noted, had\nto do with the Justice Department’s years-old objection to\n“a failure by the State to create a second majority minority\ndistrict” (that is, in addition to District 1). Id., at 478.\nThe submission then went on to explain that after consid-\nering alternatives, the redistricters had designed a version\nof District 12 that would raise its BVAP to 50.7%. Thus,\nconcluded the State, the new District 12 “increases[ ] the\nAfrican-American community’s ability to elect their candi-\ndate of choice.” Id., at 479. In the District Court’s view,\nthat passage once again indicated that making District 12\nmajority-minority was no “mere coincidence,” but a delib-\nerate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.\n159 F. Supp. 3d, at 617.9\n   And still there was more: Perhaps the most dramatic\ntestimony in the trial came when Congressman Mel Watt\n(who had represented District 12 for some 20 years) re-\ncounted a conversation he had with Rucho in 2011 about\nthe district’s future make-up. According to Watt, Rucho\n——————\n  9 The dissent’s contrary reading of the preclearance submission—as\n\nreporting the redistricters’ “decis[ion] not to construct District 12 as a\nmajority-minority district,” post, at 24—is difficult to fathom. The\nlanguage the dissent cites explains only why Rucho and Lewis rejected\none particular way of creating such a district; the submission then\nrelates their alternative (and, of course, successful) approach to attain-\ning an over-50% BVAP. See App. 478–479.\n\f24                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsaid that “his leadership had told him that he had to ramp\nthe minority percentage in [District 12] up to over 50\npercent to comply with the Voting Rights Law.” App.\n2369; see id., at 2393. And further, that it would then be\nRucho’s “job to go and convince the African-American\ncommunity” that such a racial target “made sense” under\nthe Act. Ibid.; see id., at 2369.10 The District Court cred-\nited Watt’s testimony about the conversation, citing his\ncourtroom demeanor and “consistent recollection” under\n“probing cross-examination.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 617–\n618.11 In the court’s view, Watt’s account was of a piece\nwith all the other evidence—including the redistricters’\non-the-nose attainment of a 50% BVAP—indicating that\nthe General Assembly, in the name of VRA compliance,\ndeliberately redrew District 12 as a majority-minority\ndistrict. See id., at 618.12\n——————\n  10 Watt recalled that he laughed in response because the VRA re-\n\nquired no such target. See id., at 2369. And he told Rucho that “the\nAfrican-American community will laugh at you” too. Ibid. Watt\nexplained to Rucho: “I’m getting 65 percent of the vote in a 40 percent\nblack district. If you ramp my [BVAP] to over 50 percent, I’ll probably\nget 80 percent of the vote, and[ ] that’s not what the Voting Rights Act\nwas designed to do.” Ibid.\n  11 The court acknowledged that, in the earlier state-court trial involv-\n\ning District 12, Rucho denied making the comments that Watt recalled.\nSee 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 617–618. But the court explained that it could\nnot “assess [the] credibility” of Rucho’s contrary account because even\nthough he was listed as a defense witness and present in the courtroom\nthroughout the trial, the State chose not to put him on the witness\nstand. Id., at 618.\n  12 The dissent conjures a different way of explaining Watt’s testi-\n\nmony. Perhaps, the dissent suggests, Rucho disclosed a majority-minority\ntarget to Watt, but Watt then changed Rucho’s mind—and perhaps it\nwas just a coincidence (or a mistake?) that Rucho still created a 50.7%-\nBVAP district. See post, at 25–26. But nothing in the record supports\nthat hypothesis. See ibid. (relying exclusively on the State’s preclear-\nance submission to back up this story); supra, at 23, and n. 9 (correcting\nthe dissent’s misreading of that submission). And the State, lacking\nthe dissent’s creativity, did not think to present it at trial.\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State’s contrary story—that politics alone drove\ndecisionmaking—came into the trial mostly through Ho-\nfeller’s testimony. Hofeller explained that Rucho and\nLewis instructed him, first and foremost, to make the map\nas a whole “more favorable to Republican candidates.”\nApp. 2682. One agreed-on stratagem in that effort was to\npack the historically Democratic District 12 with even\nmore Democratic voters, thus leaving surrounding dis-\ntricts more reliably Republican. See id., at 2682–2683,\n2696–2697. To that end, Hofeller recounted, he drew\nDistrict 12’s new boundaries based on political data—\nspecifically, the voting behavior of precincts in the 2008\nPresidential election between Barack Obama and John\nMcCain. See id., at 2701–2702. Indeed, he claimed, he\ndisplayed only this data, and no racial data, on his com-\nputer screen while mapping the district. See id., at 2721.\nIn part of his testimony, Hofeller further stated that the\nObama-McCain election data explained (among other\nthings) his incorporation of the black, but not the white,\nparts of Guilford County then located in District 13. See\nid., at 2824. Only after he drew a politics-based line be-\ntween those adjacent areas, Hofeller testified, did he\n“check[ ]” the racial data and “f[ind] out” that the resulting\nconfiguration of District 12 “did not have a [§5] issue.” Id.,\nat 2822.\n   The District Court, however, disbelieved Hofeller’s\nasserted indifference to the new district’s racial composi-\ntion. The court recalled Hofeller’s contrary deposition\ntestimony—his statement (repeated in only slightly differ-\nent words in his expert report) that Rucho and Lewis\n“decided” to shift African-American voters into District 12\n“in order to” ensure preclearance under §5. See 159\nF. Supp. 3d, at 619–620; App. 558. And the court ex-\nplained that even at trial, Hofeller had given testimony\nthat undermined his “blame it on politics” claim. Right\nafter asserting that Rucho and Lewis had told him “[not]\n\f26                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto use race” in designing District 12, Hofeller added a\nqualification: “except perhaps with regard to Guilford\nCounty.” Id., at 2791; see id., at 2790. As the District\nCourt understood, that is the kind of “exception” that goes\npretty far toward swallowing the rule. District 12 saw a\nnet increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford\nCounty, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across\nthe district: So the newly added parts of that county\nplayed a major role in pushing the district’s BVAP over\n50%. See id., at 384, 500–502.13 The District Court came\naway from Hofeller’s self-contradictory testimony unper-\nsuaded that this decisive influx of black voters was an\naccident. Whether the racial make-up of the county was\ndisplayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his head,\nthe court thought, Hofeller’s denial of race-based district-\ning “r[ang] hollow.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 620, n. 8.\n  Finally, an expert report by Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere\nlent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs’ race-not-\npolitics case. Ansolabehere looked at the six counties\noverlapping with District 12—essentially the region from\nwhich the mapmakers could have drawn the district’s\npopulation. The question he asked was: Who from those\ncounties actually ended up in District 12? The answer he\nfound was: Only 16% of the region’s white registered\nvoters, but 64% of the black ones. See App. 321–322.\nAnsolabehere next controlled for party registration, but\n——————\n  13 The dissent charges that this comparison is misleading, but offers\nno good reason why that is so. See post, at 29–30. It is quite true, as\nthe dissent notes, that another part of District 12 (in Mecklenburg\nCounty) experienced a net increase in black voters even larger than the\none in Guilford County. See post, at 30. (The net increases in the two\ncounties thus totaled more than 35,000; they were then partially offset\nby net decreases in other counties in District 12.) But that is irrelevant\nto the point made here: Without the numerous black voters added to\nDistrict 12 in Guilford County—where the evidence most clearly\nindicates voters were chosen based on race—the district would have\nfallen well shy of majority-minority status.\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    27\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovered that doing so made essentially no difference:\nFor example, only 18% of the region’s white Democrats\nwound up in District 12, whereas 65% of the black Demo-\ncrats did. See id., at 332. The upshot was that, regardless\nof party, a black voter was three to four times more likely\nthan a white voter to cast his ballot within District 12’s\nborders. See ibid. Those stark disparities led An-\nsolabehere to conclude that “race, and not party,” was “the\ndominant factor” in District 12’s design. Id., at 337.14 His\nreport, as the District Court held, thus tended to confirm\nthe plaintiffs’ direct evidence of racial predominance. See\n159 F. Supp. 3d, at 620–621.\n  The District Court’s assessment that all this evidence\nproved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error\nreview. The court emphasized that the districting plan’s\nown architects had repeatedly described the influx of\nAfrican-Americans into District 12 as a §5 compliance\nmeasure, not a side-effect of political gerrymandering.\n——————\n  14 Hofeller did not dispute Ansolabehere’s figures, but questioned his\ninference. Those striking patterns, the mapmaker claimed, were\nnothing more than the result of his own reliance on voting data from\nthe 2008 Presidential election—because that information (i.e., who\nvoted for Obama and who for McCain) tracked race better than it did\nparty registration. See App. 1101, 1111–1114; cf. Cromartie II, 532\nU. S. 234, 245 (2001) (recognizing that “party registration and party\npreference do not always correspond”). As we have just recounted,\nhowever, the District Court had other reasons to disbelieve Hofeller’s\ntestimony that he used solely that electoral data to draw District 12’s\nlines. See supra, at 25–26. And Ansolabehere contended that even if\nHofeller did so, that choice of data could itself suggest an intent to sort\nvoters by race. Voting results from a “single [Presidential] election\nwith a Black candidate,” Ansolabehere explained, would be a “problem-\natic and unusual” indicator of future party preference, because of the\nracial dynamics peculiar to such a match-up. App. 341; see id., at 342–\n343. That data would, indeed, be much more useful as a reflection of an\narea’s racial composition: “The Obama vote,” Ansolabehere found, is “an\nextremely strong positive indicator of the location of Black registered\nvoters” and, conversely, an “extremely strong negative indicator of the\nlocation of White registered voters.” Id., at 342; see id., at 2546–2550.\n\f28                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd those contemporaneous descriptions comported with\nthe court’s credibility determinations about the trial tes-\ntimony—that Watt told the truth when he recounted\nRucho’s resolve to hit a majority-BVAP target; and con-\nversely that Hofeller skirted the truth (especially as to\nGuilford County) when he claimed to have followed only\nrace-blind criteria in drawing district lines. We cannot\ndisrespect such credibility judgments. See Anderson, 470\nU. S., at 575 (A choice to believe “one of two or more wit-\nnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially\nplausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evi-\ndence,” can “virtually never be clear error”). And more\ngenerally, we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the\ntrial evidence as if we were the first to hear it. See id., at\n573 (A “reviewing court oversteps” under Rule 52(a) “if it\nundertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court”). No\ndoubt other interpretations of that evidence were permis-\nsible. Maybe we would have evaluated the testimony\ndifferently had we presided over the trial; or then again,\nmaybe we would not have. Either way—and it is only this\nwhich matters—we are far from having a “definite and\nfirm conviction” that the District Court made a mistake in\nconcluding from the record before it that racial considera-\ntions predominated in District 12’s design.\n                              B\n  The State mounts a final, legal rather than factual,\nattack on the District Court’s finding of racial predomi-\nnance. When race and politics are competing explanations\nof a district’s lines, argues North Carolina, the party\nchallenging the district must introduce a particular kind\nof circumstantial evidence: “an alternative [map] that\nachieves the legislature’s political objectives while improv-\ning racial balance.” Brief for Appellants 31 (emphasis\ndeleted). That is true, the State says, irrespective of what\nother evidence is in the case—so even if the plaintiff offers\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npowerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map\nit did for racial reasons. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Because\nthe plaintiffs here (as all agree) did not present such a\ncounter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot\nprevail. The dissent echoes that argument. See post, at\n6–11.\n   We have no doubt that an alternative districting plan, of\nthe kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key evi-\ndence in a race-versus-politics dispute. One, often highly\npersuasive way to disprove a State’s contention that poli-\ntics drove a district’s lines is to show that the legislature\nhad the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals with-\nout moving so many members of a minority group into the\ndistrict. If you were really sorting by political behavior\ninstead of skin color (so the argument goes) you would\nhave done—or, at least, could just as well have done—this.\nSuch would-have, could-have, and (to round out the set)\nshould-have arguments are a familiar means of undermin-\ning a claim that an action was based on a permissible,\nrather than a prohibited, ground. See, e.g., Miller-El v.\nDretke, 545 U. S. 231, 249 (2005) (“If that were the [real]\nexplanation for striking [juror] Warren[,] the prosecutors\nshould have struck [juror] Jenkins” too).\n   But they are hardly the only means. Suppose that the\nplaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of\nleaked emails from state officials instructing their map-\nmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a\ndistrict, or telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%.\nBased on such evidence, a court could find that racial\nrather than political factors predominated in a district’s\ndesign, with or without an alternative map. And so too in\ncases lacking that kind of smoking gun, as long as the\nevidence offered satisfies the plaintiff ’s burden of proof.\nIn Bush v. Vera, for example, this Court upheld a finding\nof racial predominance based on “substantial direct evi-\ndence of the legislature’s racial motivations”—including\n\f30                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredible testimony from political figures and statements\nmade in a §5 preclearance submission—plus circumstan-\ntial evidence that redistricters had access to racial, but not\npolitical, data at the “block-by-block level” needed to ex-\nplain their “intricate” designs. See 517 U. S., at 960–963\n(plurality opinion). Not a single Member of the Court\nthought that the absence of a counter-map made any\ndifference. Similarly, it does not matter in this case,\nwhere the plaintiffs’ introduction of mostly direct and\nsome circumstantial evidence—documents issued in the\nredistricting process, testimony of government officials,\nexpert analysis of demographic patterns—gave the Dis-\ntrict Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the\nrace-or-politics question.\n   A plaintiff ’s task, in other words, is simply to persuade\nthe trial court—without any special evidentiary prerequi-\nsite—that race (not politics) was the “predominant consid-\neration in deciding to place a significant number of voters\nwithin or without a particular district.” Alabama, 575\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); cf. Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op.,\nat 8, 10) (rejecting a similar effort to elevate one form of\n“persuasive circumstantial evidence” in a dispute respect-\ning racial predominance to a “mandatory precondition” or\n“threshold requirement” of proof). That burden of proof,\nwe have often held, is “demanding.” E.g., Cromartie II,\n532 U. S., at 241. And because that is so, a plaintiff will\nsometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter,\nto make his case. But in no area of our equal protection\nlaw have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form\nof proof to prevail. See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266–268 (1977)\n(offering a varied and non-exhaustive list of “subjects of\nproper inquiry in determining whether racially discrimi-\nnatory intent existed”). Nor would it make sense to do so\nhere. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the unjusti-\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

An alternative\nmap is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a\nsubstantive violation has occurred; neither its presence\nnor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering\nclaim.15\n   North Carolina insists, however, that we have already\nsaid to the contrary—more particularly, that our decision\nin Cromartie II imposed a non-negotiable “alternative-map\nrequirement.” Brief for Appellants 31. As the State ob-\nserves, Cromartie II reversed as clearly erroneous a trial\ncourt’s finding that race, rather than politics, predominated\n——————\n   15 The dissent responds that an alternative-map requirement “should\n\nnot be too hard” for plaintiffs (or at least “sophisticated” litigants “like\nthose in the present case”) to meet. Post, at 10–11. But if the plaintiffs\nhave already proved by a preponderance of the evidence that race\npredominated in drawing district lines, then we have no warrant to\ndemand that they jump through additional evidentiary hoops (whether\nthe exercise would cost a hundred dollars or a million, a week’s more\ntime or a year’s). Or at least that would be so if we followed the usual\nrules. Underlying the dissent’s view that we should not—that we\nshould instead create a special evidentiary burden—is its belief that\n“litigation of this sort” often seeks to “obtain in court what [a political\nparty] could not achieve in the political arena,” post, at 9, and so that\nlittle is lost by making suits like this one as hard as possible. But\nwhatever the possible motivations for bringing such suits (and the\ndissent says it is not questioning “what occurred here,” ibid.), they\nserve to prevent legislatures from taking unconstitutional districting\naction—which happens more often than the dissent must suppose.\nState lawmakers sometimes misunderstand the VRA’s requirements\n(as may have occurred here with respect to §5), leading them to employ\nrace as a predominant districting criterion when they should not. See\nsupra, at 22–24, and n. 10. Or they may resort to race-based districting\nfor ultimately political reasons, leveraging the strong correlation\nbetween race and voting behavior to advance their partisan interests.\nSee nn. 1, 7, supra. Or, finally—though we hope less commonly—they\nmay simply seek to suppress the electoral power of minority voters.\nWhen plaintiffs meet their burden of showing that such conduct has\noccurred, there is no basis for subjecting them to additional—and\nunique—evidentiary hurdles, preventing them from receiving the\nremedy to which they are entitled.\n\f32                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the assignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of\nDistrict 12. See 532 U. S., at 241; supra, at 5. And as the\nState emphasizes, a part of our opinion faulted the\nCromartie plaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing ac-\ncount of how the legislature could have accomplished its\npolitical goals other than through the map it chose. See\n532 U. S., at 257–258. We there stated:\n     “In a case such as this one where majority-minority\n     districts . . . are at issue and where racial identifica-\n     tion correlates highly with political affiliation, the\n     party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries\n     must show at the least that the legislature could have\n     achieved its legitimate political objectives in alterna-\n     tive ways that are comparably consistent with tradi-\n     tional districting principles. That party must also\n     show that those districting alternatives would have\n     brought about significantly greater racial balance.”\n     Id., at 258.\nAccording to North Carolina, that passage alone settles\nthis case, because it makes an alternative map “essential”\nto a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district\nin which race and partisanship are correlated) was a racial\ngerrymander. Reply Brief 11. Once again, the dissent\nsays the same. See post, at 7.\n   But the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading.\nThe Court’s opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or\njustify the categorical rule that the State claims to find\nthere. (Certainly the dissent’s current defense of that\nrule, see post, at 8–11, was nowhere in evidence.) And\ngiven the strangeness of that rule—which would treat a\nmere form of evidence as the very substance of a constitu-\ntional claim, see supra, at 29–31—we cannot think that\nthe Court adopted it without any explanation. Still more,\nthe entire thrust of the Cromartie II opinion runs counter\nto an inflexible counter-map requirement. If the Court\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhad adopted that rule, it would have had no need to weigh\neach piece of evidence in the case and determine whether,\ntaken together, they were “adequate” to show “the pre-\ndominance of race in the legislature’s line-drawing pro-\ncess.” 532 U. S., at 243–244. But that is exactly what\nCromartie II did, over a span of 20 pages and in exhaus-\ntive detail. Item by item, the Court discussed and disman-\ntled the supposed proof, both direct and circumstantial, of\nrace-based redistricting. All that careful analysis would\nhave been superfluous—that dogged effort wasted—if the\nCourt viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of\nevidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.\n   Rightly understood, the passage from Cromartie II had a\ndifferent and narrower point, arising from and reflecting\nthe evidence offered in that case. The direct evidence of a\nracial gerrymander, we thought, was extremely weak: We\nsaid of one piece that it “says little or nothing about\nwhether race played a predominant role” in drawing dis-\ntrict lines; we said of another that it “is less persuasive\nthan the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant\nin other redistricting cases.” Id., at 253–254 (emphasis\ndeleted). Nor did the report of the plaintiffs’ expert im-\npress us overmuch: In our view, it “offer[ed] little insight\ninto the legislature’s true motive.” Id., at 248. That left a\nset of arguments of the would-have-could-have variety.\nFor example, the plaintiffs offered several maps purport-\ning to “show how the legislature might have swapped”\nsome mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain\ngreater racial balance “without harming [the legislature’s]\npolitical objective.” Id., at 255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But the Court determined that none of those\nproposed exchanges would have worked as advertised—\nessentially, that the plaintiffs’ “you could have redistricted\ndifferently” arguments failed on their own terms. See id.,\nat 254–257. Hence emerged the demand quoted above, for\nmaps that would actually show what the plaintiffs’ had\n\f34                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot. In a case like Cromartie II—that is, one in which the\nplaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerry-\nmander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alterna-\ntives—only maps of that kind could carry the day. Id., at\n258.\n   But this case is most unlike Cromartie II, even though it\ninvolves the same electoral district some twenty years on.\nThis case turned not on the possibility of creating more\noptimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of\nthe General Assembly’s intent in creating the actual Dis-\ntrict 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to\ncredibility determinations. That evidence, the District\nCourt plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs’ burden\nof debunking North Carolina’s “it was really politics”\ndefense; there was no need for an alternative map to do\nthe same job. And we pay our precedents no respect when\nwe extend them far beyond the circumstances for which\nthey were designed.\n                              V\n  Applying a clear error standard, we uphold the District\nCourt’s conclusions that racial considerations predominated\nin designing both District 1 and District 12. For District\n12, that is all we must do, because North Carolina has\nmade no attempt to justify race-based districting there.\nFor District 1, we further uphold the District Court’s\ndecision that §2 of the VRA gave North Carolina no good\nreason to reshuffle voters because of their race. We ac-\ncordingly affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of

S. C. §10301 et seq. I\nwrite briefly to explain the additional grounds on which I\nwould affirm the three-judge District Court and to note my\nagreement, in particular, with the Court’s clear-error\nanalysis.\n   As to District 1, I think North Carolina’s concession that\nit created the district as a majority-black district is by\nitself sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. See Brief for\nAppellants 44; see also, e.g., Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State\nBd. of Elections, 580 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2017) (slip op., at\n1–2) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). I also think that North Carolina\ncannot satisfy strict scrutiny based on its efforts to comply\nwith §2 of the VRA. See ante, at 12. In my view, §2 does\nnot apply to redistricting and therefore cannot justify a\nracial gerrymander. See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874,\n922–923 (1994) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   As to District 12, I agree with the Court that the Dis-\ntrict Court did not clearly err when it determined that\nrace was North Carolina’s predominant motive in drawing\nthe district. See ante, at 21. This is the same conclusion I\n\f2                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nreached when we last reviewed District 12. Easley v.\nCromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 267 (2001) (Cromartie II) (dis-\nsenting opinion). The Court reached the contrary conclu-\nsion in Cromartie II only by misapplying our deferential\nstandard for reviewing factual findings. See id., at 259–\n262. Today’s decision does not repeat Cromartie II’s error,\nand indeed it confines that case to its particular facts. It\nthus represents a welcome course correction to this Court’s\napplication of the clear-error standard.\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U.

But that is\nwhat the Court does today in its decision regarding North\nCarolina’s 12th Congressional District: The Court junks a\nrule adopted in a prior, remarkably similar challenge to\nthis very same congressional district.\n   In Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234 (2001) (Cromartie\nII ), the Court considered the constitutionality of the ver-\nsion of District 12 that was adopted in 1997. Id., at 238.\nThat district had the same basic shape as the district now\nbefore us, and the challengers argued that the legislature’s\npredominant reason for adopting this configuration was\nrace. Ibid. The State responded that its motive was not\nrace but politics. Id., at 241. Its objective, the State in-\nsisted, was to create a district in which the Democratic\ncandidate would win. See ibid.; Brief for State Appellants\nin Easley v. Cromartie, O. T. 2000, Nos. 99–1864, 99–\n1865, p. 25. Rejecting that explanation, a three-judge\ncourt found that the legislature’s predominant motive was\nracial, specifically to pack African-Americans into District\n\f2                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n12. See Cromartie v. Hunt, 133 F. Supp. 2d 407, 420\n(EDNC 2000). But this Court held that this finding of fact\nwas clearly erroneous. Cromartie II, 532 U. S., at 256.\n   A critical factor in our analysis was the failure of those\nchallenging the district to come forward with an alterna-\ntive redistricting map that served the legislature’s politi-\ncal objective as well as the challenged version without\nproducing the same racial effects. Noting that race and\nparty affiliation in North Carolina were “highly corre-\nlated,” id., at 243, we laid down this rule:\n    “In a case such as this one . . . , the party attacking\n    the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the\n    least that the legislature could have achieved its legit-\n    imate political objectives in alternative ways that are\n    comparably consistent with traditional districting\n    principles. That party must also show that those dis-\n    tricting alternatives would have brought about signif-\n    icantly greater racial balance. Appellees failed to\n    make any such showing here.” Id., at 258.\n  Now, District 12 is back before us. After the 2010 cen-\nsus, the North Carolina Legislature, with the Republicans\nin the majority, drew the present version of District 12.\nThe challengers contend that this version violates equal\nprotection because the predominant motive of the legisla-\nture was racial: to pack the district with African-American\nvoters. The legislature responds that its objective was\npolitical: to pack the district with Democrats and thus to\nincrease the chances of Republican candidates in neigh-\nboring districts.\n  You might think that the Cromartie II rule would be\nequally applicable in this case, which does not differ in\nany relevant particular, but the majority executes a stun-\nning about-face. Now, the challengers’ failure to produce\nan alternative map that meets the Cromartie II test is\ninconsequential. It simply “does not matter.” Ante, at 30.\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  This is not the treatment of precedent that state legisla-\ntures have the right to expect from this Court. The failure\nto produce an alternative map doomed the challengers in\nCromartie II, and the same should be true now. Partisan\ngerrymandering is always unsavory, but that is not the\nissue here. The issue is whether District 12 was drawn\npredominantly because of race. The record shows that it\nwas not.1\n                              I\n   Under the Constitution, state legislatures have “the\ninitial power to draw districts for federal elections.” Vieth\nv. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 275 (2004) (plurality opinion).2\nThis power, of course, must be exercised in conformity\nwith the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection\nClause. And because the Equal Protection Clause’s “cen-\ntral mandate is racial neutrality in governmental deci-\nsionmaking,” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 904 (1995),\n“effort[s] to separate voters into different districts on the\nbasis of race” must satisfy the rigors of strict scrutiny.\nShaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649, 653 (1993) (Shaw I ).\n   We have stressed, however, that courts are obligated to\n“exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that\na State has drawn district lines on the basis of race.”\nMiller, 515 U. S., at 916. “Federal-court review of district-\ning legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most\nvital of local functions,” and “the good faith of a state\nlegislature must be presumed.” Id., at 915. A legislature\n——————\n   1 I concur in the judgment of the Court regarding Congressional Dis-\n\ntrict 1. The State concedes that the district was intentionally created\nas a majority-minority district. See Brief for Appellants 44. And\nappellants have not satisfied strict scrutiny.\n   2 Article I, §4, of the Constitution reserves to state legislatures the\n\npower to prescribe “[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections\nfor Senators and Representatives,” subject to Congress’s authority to\n“make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing\nSenators.”\n\f4                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nwill “almost always be aware of racial demographics”\nduring redistricting, but evidence of such awareness does\nnot show that the legislature violated equal protection.\nId., at 916. Instead, the Court has held, “[r]ace must not\nsimply have been a motivation for the drawing of a majority-\nminority district, but the predominant factor motivating\nthe legislature’s districting decision.” Cromartie II, 532\nU. S., at 241 (citation and internal quotation marks omit-\nted; emphasis in original).\n   This evidentiary burden “is a demanding one.” Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, although “[t]he\nlegislature’s motivation is . . . a factual question,” Hunt v.\nCromartie, 526 U. S. 541, 549 (1999) (Cromartie I ), an\nappellate court conducting clear-error review must always\nkeep in mind the heavy evidentiary obligation borne by\nthose challenging a districting plan. See Cromartie II,\nsupra, at 241, 257. Recognizing “the intrusive potential of\njudicial intervention into the legislative realm,” Miller,\nsupra, at 916, we have warned that courts must be very\ncautious about imputing a racial motive to a State’s redis-\ntricting plan.\n                               II\n   That caution “is especially appropriate . . . where the\nState has articulated a legitimate political explanation for\nits districting decision, and the voting population is one in\nwhich race and political affiliation are highly correlated.”\nCromartie II, 532 U. S., at 242. We have repeatedly\nacknowledged the problem of distinguishing between\nracial and political motivations in the redistricting con-\ntext. See id., at 242, 257–258; Cromartie I, supra, at 551–\n552; Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 967–968 (1996) (plurality\nopinion).\n   The problem arises from the confluence of two factors.\nThe first is the status under the Constitution of partisan\ngerrymandering. As we have acknowledged, “[p]olitics\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                       5\n\n                            Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nand political considerations are inseparable from district-\ning and apportionment,” Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S.\n735, 753 (1973), and it is well known that state legislative\nmajorities very often attempt to gain an electoral ad-\nvantage through that process. See Davis v. Bandemer,\n478 U. S. 109, 129 (1986). Partisan gerrymandering dates\nback to the founding, see Vieth, supra, at 274–276 (plural-\nity opinion), and while some might find it distasteful, “[o]ur\nprior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may\nengage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if\nit so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be\nblack Democrats and even if the State were conscious of\nthat fact.” Cromartie I, supra, at 551 (emphasis in origi-\nnal); Vera, supra, at 964 (plurality opinion).\n   The second factor is that “racial identification is highly\ncorrelated with political affiliation” in many jurisdictions.\nCromartie II, 532 U. S., at 243 (describing correlation in\nNorth Carolina). This phenomenon makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between political and race-based decisionmak-\ning. If around 90% of African-American voters cast their\nballots for the Democratic candidate, as they have in\nrecent elections,3 a plan that packs Democratic voters will\nlook very much like a plans that packs African-American\nvoters. “[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Demo-\ncratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end\nup with a district containing more heavily African–\n——————\n  3 According   to polling data, around 90% of African-American\nvoters have voted for the Democratic candidate for President in\nrecent years.

Id., at 239–241. Our review for clear error in\nthat case did not exhibit the same diffidence as today’s\ndecision. We carefully examined each piece of direct and\ncircumstantial evidence on which the District Court had\nrelied and conceded that this evidence provided support\nfor the court’s finding. Id., at 257. Then, at the end of our\nopinion, we stated:\n      “We can put the matter more generally as follows:\n    In a case such as this one where majority-minority\n    districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue\n    and where racial identification correlates highly with\n    political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively\n    drawn boundaries must show at the least that the\n    legislature could have achieved its legitimate political\n    objectives in alternative ways that are comparably\n    consistent with traditional districting principles.\n    That party must also show that those districting al-\n    ternatives would have brought about significantly\n    greater racial balance.” Id., at 258.\nBecause the plaintiffs had “failed to make any such show-\ning,” we held that the District Court had clearly erred in\nfinding that race predominated in drawing District 12.\nIbid.\n   Cromartie II plainly meant to establish a rule for use in\na broad class of cases and not a rule to be employed one\ntime only. We stated that we were “put[ting] the matter\nmore generally” and were describing what must be shown\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nin cases “where majority-minority districts (or the approx-\nimate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identifica-\ntion correlates highly with political affiliation.” Ibid. We\nidentified who would carry the burden of the new rule\n(“the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries”)\nand what that party must show (that “the legislature\ncould have achieved its legitimate political objectives in\nalternative ways that are comparably consistent with\ntraditional districting principles” while achieving “signifi-\ncantly greater racial balance”). Ibid. And we reversed the\nfinding of racial predominance due to the plaintiffs’ failure\nto carry the burden established by this evidentiary rule.\nIbid.\n   Here, too, the plaintiffs failed to carry that burden. In\nthis case, as in Cromartie II, the plaintiffs allege a racial\ngerrymander, and the State’s defense is that political\nmotives explain District 12’s boundaries. In such a case,\nCromartie II instructed, plaintiffs must submit an alterna-\ntive redistricting map demonstrating that the legislature\ncould have achieved its political goals without the racial\neffects giving rise to the racial gerrymandering allegation.\nBut in spite of this instruction, plaintiffs in this case failed\nto submit such a map.4 See Brief for Appellees 31–36.\nBased on what we said in Cromartie II about the same type\nof claim involving the same congressional district, reversal\nshould be a foregone conclusion. It turns out, however,\nthat the Cromartie II rule was good for one use only. Even\nin a case involving the very same district, it is tossed\naside.\n\n\n——————\n  4 The challengers’ failure to do so is especially glaring given that at\n\nleast two alternative maps were introduced during the legislative\ndebates over the 2011 map, see 2 Record 357–366, 402–411; App. 883–\n887, though neither party contends that those maps met the legisla-\nture’s political goals.\n\f8                     COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The alternative-map requirement deserves better. It is\na logical response to the difficult problem of distinguishing\nbetween racial and political motivations when race and\npolitical party preference closely correlate.\n   This is a problem with serious institutional and federal-\nism implications. When a federal court says that race was\na legislature’s predominant purpose in drawing a district,\nit accuses the legislature of “offensive and demeaning”\nconduct. Miller, 515 U. S., at 912. Indeed, we have said\nthat racial gerrymanders “bea[r] an uncomfortable re-\nsemblance to political apartheid.” Shaw I, 509 U. S.,\nat 647. That is a grave accusation to level against a state\nlegislature.\n   In addition, “[f]ederal-court review of districting legisla-\ntion represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of\nlocal functions” because “[i]t is well settled that reappor-\ntionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the\nState.” Miller, supra, at 915 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Cromartie II, 532 U. S., at 242. When a\nfederal court finds that race predominated in the redis-\ntricting process, it inserts itself into that process. That is\nappropriate—indeed, constitutionally required—if the\nlegislature truly did draw district boundaries on the basis\nof race. But if a court mistakes a political gerrymander for\na racial gerrymander, it illegitimately invades a traditional\ndomain of state authority, usurping the role of a State’s\nelected representatives. This does violence to both the\nproper role of the Judiciary and the powers reserved to the\nStates under the Constitution.\n   There is a final, often-unstated danger where race and\npolitics correlate: that the federal courts will be trans-\nformed into weapons of political warfare. Unless courts\n“exercise extraordinary caution” in distinguishing race-\nbased redistricting from politics-based redistricting, Mil-\nler, supra, at 916, they will invite the losers in the redis-\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

If the majority party\ndraws districts to favor itself, the minority party can deny\nthe majority its political victory by prevailing on a racial\ngerrymandering claim. Even if the minority party loses in\ncourt, it can exact a heavy price by using the judicial\nprocess to engage in political trench warfare for years on\nend.\n   Although I do not imply that this is what occurred here,\nthis case does reflect what litigation of this sort can look\nlike. This is the fifth time that North Carolina’s 12th\nCongressional District has come before this Court since\n1993, and we have almost reached a new redistricting\ncycle without any certainty as to the constitutionality of\nNorth Carolina’s current redistricting map. Given these\ndangers, Cromartie II was justified in crafting an eviden-\ntiary rule to prevent false positives.5\n                             C\n   The majority nevertheless absolves the challengers of\ntheir failure to submit an alternative map. It argues that\nan alternative map cannot be “the only means” of proving\nracial predominance, and it concludes from this that an\nalternative map “does not matter in this case.” Ante, at\n29–30 (emphasis in original). But even if there are cases\nin which a plaintiff could prove a racial gerrymandering\nclaim without an alternative map, they would be excep-\ntional ones in which the evidence of racial predominance is\n\n——————\n  5 Ignoring all of these well-founded reasons supporting the alternative-\nmap requirement, the majority mischaracterizes my argument as, at\nbottom, resting on the proposition that “little is lost by making suits\nlike this one as hard as possible.” Ante, at 31, n. 15. That is not my\nview, and it is richly ironic for the Court that announced the alternative-\nmap requirement to accuse those who defend the requirement of erecting\nillegitimate and unnecessary barriers to the vindication of constitu-\ntional rights.\n\f10                       COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\noverwhelming. This most definitely is not one of those\ncases, see Part III–C, infra, and the plaintiffs’ failure to\nproduce an alternative map mandates reversal. Moreover,\neven in an exceptional case, the absence of such a map\nwould still be strong evidence that a district’s boundaries\nwere determined by politics rather than race.6 The ab-\nsence of a map would “matter.” Cf. ante, at 30.\n   The majority questions the legitimacy of the alternative-\nmap requirement, ante, at 29–31, and n. 15, but the rule is\na sound one. It rests on familiar principles regarding the\nallocation of the burdens of production and persuasion and\nthe assessment of evidence. First, in accordance with the\ngeneral rule in civil cases, plaintiffs in a case like this bear\nthe burden of proving that the legislature’s motive was\nunconstitutional. Second, what must be shown is not\nsimply that race played a part in the districting process\nbut that it played the predominant role. Third, a party\nchallenging a districting plan must overcome the strong\npresumption that the plan was drawn for constitutionally\npermissible reasons. Miller, supra, at 915. Fourth, when\nthose responsible for adopting a challenged plan contend\nthat the plan was devised for partisan political ends, they\nare making an admission that may not sit well with vot-\ners, so the explanation should not be lightly dismissed. Cf.\nFed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3). And finally, the Cromartie II\nrule takes into account the difficulty of proving a negative.\n   For challengers like those in the present case, producing\na map that meets the Cromartie II test should not be hard\nif the predominant reason for a challenged plan really was\nrace and not politics. Plaintiffs mounting a challenge to a\ndistricting plan are almost always sophisticated litigants\n——————\n   6 The majority cites Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952 (1996), as proof that\n\nthe lack of an alternative-map requirement has not “made any differ-\nence” in our past cases. Ante, at 30. Vera was decided before Cromartie\nII, 532 U. S. 234 (2001), announced the alternative-map requirement,\nso its failure to mention that requirement is hardly surprising.\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

Today, an expert with a computer\ncan easily churn out redistricting maps that control for\nany number of specified criteria, including prior voting\npatterns and political party registration. Therefore, if it is\nindeed possible to find a map that meets the Cromartie II\ntest, it should not be too hard for the challengers to do so.\nThe State, on the other hand, cannot prove that no map\nmeeting the Cromartie II test can be drawn. Even if a\nState submits, say, 100 alternative maps that fail the test,\nthat would not prove that no such map could pass it. The\nrelative ease with which the opposing parties can gather\nevidence is a familiar consideration in allocating the bur-\nden of production. See 1 C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick,\nFederal Evidence §63, p. 316 (2d ed. 1994); 21 C. Wright &\nK. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure §5122, pp.\n556–557 (1977).\n                             III\n   Even if we set aside the challengers’ failure to submit an\nalternative map, the District Court’s finding that race\npredominated in the drawing of District 12 is clearly\nerroneous. The State offered strong and coherent evidence\nthat politics, not race, was the legislature’s predominant\naim, and the evidence supporting the District Court’s\ncontrary finding is weak and manifestly inadequate in\nlight of the high evidentiary standard that our cases\nrequire challengers to meet in order to prove racial\npredominance.7\n——————\n   7 The majority accuses me of failing to accord proper deference to the\n\nDistrict Court’s factual findings and of disregarding the clear-error\nstandard of review, ante, at 20, n. 8, but that is nonsense. Unlike the\nmajority, I simply follow Cromartie II by evaluating the District Court’s\nfindings in light of the plaintiffs’ burden. See 532 U. S., at 241, 257.\nThe heavier a plaintiffs’ evidentiary burden, the harder it is to find that\nplaintiffs have carried their burden—and the more likely that it would\n\f12                       COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  My analysis will proceed in three steps. First, I will\ndiscuss what the legislature’s mapmaker did and why this\napproach is entirely consistent with his stated political\nobjectives. Then, I will explain why this approach inevita-\nbly had the racial effect to which the challengers object.\nFinally, I will address the evidence of racial predominance\non which the majority relies and show why it is inade-\nquate to sustain the District Court’s judgment.\n                             A\n   In order to understand the mapmaker’s approach, the\nfirst element to be kept in mind is that the basic shape of\nDistrict 12 was legitimately taken as a given. When a new\ncensus requires redistricting, it is a common practice to\nstart with the plan used in the prior map and to change\nthe boundaries of the prior districts only as needed to\ncomply with the one-person, one-vote mandate and to\nachieve other desired ends. This approach honors settled\nexpectations and, if the prior plan survived legal chal-\nlenge, minimizes the risk that the new plan will be over-\nturned. And that is the approach taken by the veteran\nmapmaker in the present case, Dr. Thomas Hofeller. App.\n523 (“the normal starting point is always from the existing\ndistricts”).\n   Dr. Hofeller began with the prior version of District 12\n——————\nbe clearly erroneous to find that they have. In this context, we are\nsupposed to presume that the North Carolina Legislature acted in good\nfaith and exercise “extraordinary caution” before rejecting the legisla-\nture’s political explanation. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915–916\n(1995). Given that the State has offered a coherent and persuasive\npolitical explanation for District 12’s boundaries, plaintiffs bear a\n“demanding” burden in attempting to prove racial predominance.\nCromartie II, supra, at 241, 257. Because the evidence they have put\nforward is so weak, see Part III–C, infra, they have failed to carry that\nburden, and it was clear error for the District Court to hold otherwise.\nSee Cromartie II, supra, at 241, 257 (applying the same clear-error\nanalysis that I apply here).\n\f                      Cite as: 581 U.

That design has\na long history. It was first adopted in 1992, and subse-\nquent redistricting plans have built on the 1992 plan.\nIbid. In Cromartie II, we sustained the constitutionality\nof the 1997 version of District 12, which featured the same\nbasic shape. See 532 U. S., at 258. And retention of this\nsame basic shape is not challenged in this case.8\n   Using the prior design as his starting point, Dr. Hofeller\nassumed that District 12 would remain a “strong Demo-\ncratic distric[t].” App. 521. He stated that he drew “the\n[overall redistricting] plan to . . . have an increased num-\nber of competitive districts for GOP candidates,” id., at\n520, and that he therefore moved more Democratic voters\ninto District 12 in order to “increase Republican opportu-\nnities in the surrounding districts,” id., at 1606.\n   Under the map now before us, District 12 is bordered by\nfour districts.9 Running counterclockwise, they are: Dis-\ntrict 5 to the northwest; District 9 to the southwest; Dis-\ntrict 8 to the southeast; and District 6 to the northeast.\nSee Appendix, ante. According to Dr. Hofeller, the aim\nwas to make these four districts—considered as a whole—\nmore secure for Republicans. App. 1606, 2696.\n   To do this, Dr. Hofeller set out in search of pockets of\nDemocratic voters that could be moved into District 12\nfrom areas adjoining or very close to District 12’s prior\nboundaries. Of the six counties through which District 12\npasses, the three most heavily Democratic (and also the\nmost populous) are Forsyth, Guilford, and Mecklenburg,\nwhich contain the major population centers of Winston-\nSalem, Greensboro, and Charlotte, respectively. See 7\n——————\n   8 This same basic shape was retained in the map proposed in the\n\nstate legislature by the Democratic leadership and in the map submit-\nted by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. See 2 Record 402, 357.\n   9 A fifth district, District 2, appears to touch District 12 at the border\n\nof Guilford and Randolph Counties, but only to a de minimis extent.\n\f14                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nRecord 480–482; App. 1141. As a measure of voting pref-\nerences, Dr. Hofeller used the results of the then-most\nrecent Presidential election, i.e., the election of 2008. Id.,\nat 1149, 2697, 2721–2722. In that election, these three\ncounties voted strongly for the Democratic candidate,\nthen-Senator Barack Obama, while the other three coun-\nties, Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan, all voted for the\nRepublican candidate, Senator John McCain. See 4 Rec-\nord 1341–1342.\n   Two of the three Democratic counties, Forsyth and\nGuilford, are located at the northern end of District 12,\nwhile the other Democratic county, Mecklenburg, is on the\nsouthern end. See Appendix, ante. The middle of the\ndistrict (often called the “corridor”) passes through the\nthree more Republican-friendly counties—Cabarrus,\nDavidson, and Rowan. Ibid. Thus, if a mapmaker sat\ndown to increase the proportion of Democrats in District\n12 and to reduce the proportion in neighboring districts,\nthe most obvious way to do that was to pull additional\nDemocrats into the district from the north and south (the\nmost populous and heavily Democratic counties) while\nshifting Republican voters out of the corridor.\n   That, in essence, is what Dr. Hofeller did—as the major-\nity acknowledges. Ante, at 6 (Dr. Hofeller “narrow[ed\nDistrict 12’s] already snakelike body while adding areas at\neither end”); App. 1150 (Table 1), 1163. Dr. Hofeller testi-\nfied that he sought to shift parts of Mecklenburg County\nout of Districts 8 and 9 (in order to reduce the percentage\nof Democrats in these two districts) and that this required\nhim to increase the coverage of Mecklenburg County in\nDistrict 12. Id., at 1142–1143, 1607, 2753.\n   Dr. Hofeller testified that he also had political plans for\nthe current map’s District 6, which differed substantially\nfrom the version in the prior map. Dr. Hofeller wanted to\nimprove the Republicans’ prospects in this new district by\nminimizing its coverage of Guilford County’s Democratic\n\f                   Cite as: 581 U.

That\nalso meant increasing the population of Guilford County\nDemocrats in District 12. Id., at 1143, 1607, 2697.\n   This influx of Democratic voters from the two most\npopulous counties in District 12 required shedding voters\nelsewhere in order to comply with this Court’s mandate of\none-person, one-vote, see Kirkpatrick v.

Parts of\nDavidson and Rowan Counties were therefore shifted to\nDistrict 5, id., at 1143, 1150 (Table 1), but Dr. Hofeller\ntestified that this would not have been sufficient to satisfy\nthe one-person, one-vote standard, so he also had to move\nvoters from heavily Democratic Forsyth County into Dis-\ntrict 5, id., at 1143, 2697, 2752–2753. Doing so did not\nundermine his political objective, he explained, because\nDistrict 5 “was stronger [for Republicans] to begin with\nand could take those [Forsyth] Democratic precincts”\nwithout endangering Republican chances in the district.\nId., at 2753; see also id., at 2697. The end result was that,\nunder the new map now at issue, the three major counties\nin the north and south constitute a larger percentage of\nDistrict 12’s total population, while the corridor lost popu-\nlation. See id., at 1150 (Table 1), 2149 (Finding 187).\n   A comparison of the 2008 Presidential election vote\nunder the old and new versions of the districts shows the\neffect of Dr. Hofeller’s map. District 8 (which, of the four\ndistricts bordering District 12 under the 2011 map, was\nthe most Democratic district) saw a drop of almost 11% in\nthe Democratic vote under the new map. See 2 Record\n354, 421. District 9 saw a drop in the percentage of regis-\ntered Democrats, id., at 350, 417, although the vote per-\ncentage for the Democratic Presidential candidate re-\n——————\n  10 District 12 was overpopulated by 2,847 people heading into the\n\n2011 redistricting cycle.

District 5, which was heavily Republican under\nthe prior map and was redrawn to absorb Democrats from\nForsyth County, saw about a 7-point swing in favor of the\nDemocratic candidate, but it remained a strong Republi-\ncan district. Ibid. New District 6 is less susceptible to\ncomparison because its boundaries are completely differ-\nent from the district bearing that number under the old\nplan, but the new District 6 was solidly Republican, with a\nRepublican Presidential vote percentage of nearly 56%.\nIbid. As stated by the state court that considered and\nrejected the same constitutional challenge now before us:\n       “By increasing the number of Democratic voters in\n     the 2011 Twelfth Congressional District located in\n     Mecklenburg and Guilford Counties, the 2011 Con-\n     gressional Plan created other districts that were more\n     competitive for Republican candidates as compared to\n     the 2001 versions of these districts . . . .” App. 2150\n     (Finding 191).\n  The results of subsequent congressional elections show\nthat Dr. Hofeller’s plan achieved its goal. In 2010, prior to\nthe adoption of the current plan, Democrats won 7 of the\n13 districts, including District 8.11 But by 2016, Republi-\ncans controlled 10 of the 13 districts, including District 8,\nand all the Republican candidates for the House of Repre-\nsentatives won their races with at least 56% of the vote.12\nIn accordance with the map’s design, the only Democratic\nseats remaining after 2016 were in Districts 1, 4, and 12.\nId., at 521.\n——————\n  11 North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11/02/2010 Official Gen-\n\neral Election Results—Statewide, http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=\n11/02/2010&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\n  12 North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11/08/2016 Official Gen-\n\neral Election Results—Statewide, http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=\n11/08/2016&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\n\f                    Cite as: 581 U.

App. 2022 (state trial court finding that “racial\nidentification correlates highly with political affiliation” in\nNorth Carolina). The challenger’s expert, Dr. Stephen\nAnsolabehere, corroborated this important point. Dr.\nAnsolabehere calculated the statewide correlation between\nrace and voting in 200813 and found a correlation of 0.8,\nwhich is “very high.” Id., at 342, 352 (Table 1). See also J.\nLevin, J. Fox, & D. Forde, Elementary Statistics in Social\nResearch 370 (12th ed. 2014); R. Witte & J.

In 2008, the Democratic\ncandidate for President was then-Senator Barack Obama, the first\nblack major party Presidential nominee, and it is true that President\nObama won a higher percentage of the nationwide African-American\nvote in 2008 (95%) than did the Democratic Presidential candidates in\n2000 (90%), 2004 (88%), and 2016 (88%). See supra, at 5, n. 3. But as\nthese figures show, the correlation between race and political party\npreference was very high in all these elections. Therefore, the use of\n2008 statistics does not appear to have substantially affected the\nanalysis.\n\f18                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nDemocrats in the area covered by the district. Under the\n2001 version of District 12—which was drawn by Demo-\ncrats and was never challenged as a racial gerrymander—\nblack registered voters constituted 71.44% of Democrats in\nthe district. 2 Record 350; see also App. 2145 (Finding\n173).14 What this means is that a mapmaker seeking to\npull Democrats into District 12 would unavoidably pull in\na very large percentage of African-Americans.\n  The distribution of Democratic voters magnified this\neffect. Dr. Hofeller’s plan required the identification of\nareas of Democratic strength that were near District 12’s\nprior boundaries. Dr. Hofeller prepared maps showing the\ndistribution of Democratic voters by precinct,15 see id., at\n1148–1149, 1176–1177, 1181, and those maps show that\nthese voters were highly concentrated around the major\nurban areas of Winston-Salem (in Forsyth County),\nGreensboro (in Guilford County), and Charlotte (in Meck-\nlenberg County). Dr. Ansolabehere, the challengers’ ex-\npert, prepared maps showing the distribution of black\nregistered voters in these same counties, see id., at 322–\n328; 1 Record 128–133, and a comparison of these two sets\nof maps reveals that the clusters of Democratic voters\ngenerally overlap with those of registered black voters. In\nother words, the population of nearby Democrats who\ncould be moved into District 12 was heavily black.\n  The upshot is that, so long as the legislature chose to\n——————\n  14 Even  two alternative redistricting plans offered prior to the enact-\nment of the 2011 map—one submitted by the Southern Coalition for\nSocial Justice and the other submitted by Democratic leaders in the\nstate legislature—retained the basic shape of District 12 and resulted\nin black voters constituting 71.53% and 69.14% of registered Demo-\ncrats, respectively. 2 Record 361 (Southern Coalition for Social Justice\nmap), 406 (Congressional Fair and Legal map); see also App. 883–887,\n2071 (Finding 34), 2145 (Finding 173).\n   15 To minimize jargon, I will use the term “precincts” to refer to vote\n\ntabulation districts (VTDs).

After all, when\nthe basic shape of District 12 was created after the 1990\ncensus, the express goal of the North Carolina Legislature\nwas to create a majority-minority district. See Shaw I,\n509 U. S., at 633–636. It has its unusual shape because it\nwas originally designed to capture pockets of black voters.\nSee Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 905–906 (1996) (Shaw\nII). Although the legislature has modified the district\nsince then, see Cromartie I, 526 U. S., at 544 (describing\nchanges from the 1991 version to the 1997 version), “it\nretains its basic ‘snakelike’ shape and continues to track\nInterstate 85.” Ibid.; 1 Record 35 (Appellees’ Complaint)\n(“Congressional District 12 has existed in roughly its\ncurrent form since 1992, when it was drawn as a majority\nAfrican-American district . . . ”); see also App. 1163 (show-\ning the 1997, 2001, and 2011 versions of District 12). The\noriginal design of the district was devised to ensure a high\nconcentration of black voters, and as long as the basic\ndesign is retained (as it has been), one would expect that\nto continue.\n   While plaintiffs failed to offer any alternative map, Dr.\nHofeller produced a map showing what District 12 would\nhave looked like if his computer was programmed simply\nto maximize the Democratic vote percentage in the dis-\ntrict, while still abiding by the requirement of one-person,\none-vote. Id., at 1148. The result was a version of District\n12 that is very similar to the version approved by the\nNorth Carolina Legislature. See id., at 1175; id., at 1615–\n1618. Indeed, this maximum-Democratic plan had a black\nvoting age population of 50.73%, which is actually higher\nthan District 12’s black voting age population of 50.66%.\nId., at 1154 (Table 5).\n\f20                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   Thus, the increase in the black voting age population of\nDistrict 12 is easily explained by a coherent (and generally\nsuccessful) political strategy. Cromartie II, 532 U. S., at\n245 (“[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic\nprecincts within a district without regard to race, end up\nwith a district containing more heavily African-American\nprecincts, but the reasons would be political rather than\nracial”).\n   Amazingly, a reader of the majority opinion (and the\nopinion of the District Court) would remain almost entirely\nignorant of the legislature’s political strategy and the\nrelationship between that strategy and the racial composi-\ntion of District 12.16 The majority’s analysis is like Ham-\nlet without the prince.17\n                             C\n   The majority focuses almost all its attention on a few\nreferences to race by those responsible for the drafting and\nadoption of the redistricting plan. But the majority reads\nfar too much into these references. First, what the plain-\ntiffs had to prove was not simply that race played some\nrole in the districting process but that it was the legisla-\n——————\n   16 The District Court’s description of the legislature’s political strat-\n\negy was cursory, and it spent no time analyzing the demographics of the\nregion. See Harris v. McCrory, 159 F. Supp. 3d 600, 618–619 (MDNC\n2016).\n   17 The majority concedes that this is a “thoroughly two-sided case,”\n\nante, at 18, n. 6, yet the majority’s opinion is thoroughly one sided. It\noffers no excuse for its failure to meaningfully describe—much less\nengage with—the State’s political explanation for District 12’s bounda-\nries. Instead, it tries to change the subject, accusing me of treating the\nState’s account as essentially uncontested. Ante, at 19, n. 6. This is a\nhollow accusation. In this opinion, I lay out the evidence supporting\nthe State’s political explanation in Parts III–A and III–B, but I do not\naccept that account at face value. Instead, I go on to demonstrate that\nthe plaintiffs’ contrary arguments are exceedingly weak (Part III–C).\nOnly after considering the evidence on both sides do I conclude that the\nState’s explanation holds up.\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U.

Second, as I have ex-\nplained, a court must exercise “extraordinary caution”\nbefore finding that a state legislature’s predominant rea-\nson for a districting plan was racial. Miller, 515 U. S., at\n916. This means that comments should not be taken out\nof context and given the most sinister possible meaning.\nThird, the findings of the state courts in a virtually identi-\ncal challenge to District 12 are entitled to respectful con-\nsideration. A North Carolina trial court, after hearing\nmuch the same evidence as the court below, found that the\nlegislature’s predominant motive was political, not racial.\nThat decision was affirmed by the North Carolina Su-\npreme Court. Dickson v. Rucho, 367 N. C. 542, 766 S. E.\n2d 238 (2014), vacated and remanded, 575 U. S. ___, aff ’d\non remand, 368 N. C. 481, 781 S. E. 2d 404 (2015), cert.\npending, No. 16–24. Even if the judgment in the state\ncase does not bar the present case under the doctrine of\nres judicata, see ante, at 7–9, the state-court finding illus-\ntrates the thinness of the plaintiffs’ proof.\n   Finally, it must be kept in mind that references to race\nby those responsible for drawing or adopting a redistrict-\ning plan are not necessarily evidence that the plan was\nadopted for improper racial reasons. Under our prece-\ndents, it is unconstitutional for the government to consider\nrace in almost any context, and therefore any mention of\nrace by the decisionmakers may be cause for suspicion.\nWe have said, however, that that is not so in the redis-\ntricting context. For one thing, a State like North Caro-\nlina that was either wholly or partially within the coverage\nof §5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 could not redistrict\nwithout heeding that provision’s prohibition against racial\nretrogression, see 52 U. S. C. §10304(b); Alabama Legisla-\ntive Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___\n(2015) (slip op., at 3–4), and therefore race had to be kept\nin mind. In addition, all legislatures must also take into\naccount the possibility of a challenge under §2 of the Vot-\n\f22                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ning Rights Act claiming that a plan illegally dilutes the\nvoting strength of a minority community. See League of\nUnited Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399,\n425 (2006). If a State ultimately concludes that it must\ntake race into account in order to comply with the Voting\nRights Act, it must show that it had a “ ‘strong basis in\nevidence’ in support of the (race-based) choice that it has\nmade.” Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 22). But those involved in the redistricting\nprocess may legitimately make statements about Voting\nRights Act compliance before deciding that the Act does\nnot provide a need for race-based districting. And it is\nunderstandable for such individuals to explain that a race-\nneutral plan happens to satisfy the criteria on which\nVoting Rights Act challengers might insist. In short,\nbecause of the Voting Rights Act, consideration and dis-\ncussion of the racial effects of a plan may be expected.\n                              1\n                The June 17, 2011, Statement\n   I begin with a piece of evidence that the majority does\nnot mention, namely, the very first item cited by the Dis-\ntrict Court in support of its racial-predominance finding.\nThis evidence consisted of a June 17, 2001, statement by\nSenator Rucho and Representative Lewis, the state legis-\nlators who took the lead in the adoption of the current\nmap. In that statement, Rucho and Lewis referred to\n“constructing [Voting Rights Act] majority black districts.”\nApp. 1025. Seizing upon the use of the plural term “dis-\ntricts,” the court below seemed to think that it had found a\nsmoking gun. Harris v. McCrory, 159 F. Supp. 3d 600, 616\n(MDNC 2016). The State had insisted that its plan drew\nonly one majority-minority congressional district, District\n1, but since the June 17 statement “clearly refers to mul-\ntiple districts that are now majority minority,” ibid., the\ncourt below viewed the statement as telling evidence that\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U.

See App. 1024–1033. The\nUnited States, as amicus curiae in support of plaintiffs,\nconcedes that the District Court made a mistake by rely-\ning on the June 17 statement. Brief for United States 27,\nn. 13. The majority, by contrast, tries to ignore this error.\nBut the District Court gave the June 17 statement pride-\nof-place in its opinion, mentioning it first in its analysis,\nand the District Court seemed to think that this evidence\nwas particularly significant, stating that the reference to\nmultiple districts was not “the result of happenstance, a\nmere slip of the pen.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 616. The Dis-\ntrict Court’s error shows a troubling lack of precision.\n                             2\n                The §5 Preclearance Request\n   Under §5 of the Voting Rights Act, North Carolina\nrequested preclearance from the Department of Justice\nshortly after the Legislature approved the new congres-\nsional plan. Id., at 608. In its preclearance application,\nthe State noted that “[o]ne of the concerns of the Redis-\ntricting Chairs was that in 1992, the Justice Department\nhad objected to the 1991 Congressional Plan because of a\nfailure by the State to create a second majority minority\ndistrict.” App. 478. The application says that the Redis-\ntricting Chairs “sought input from Congressman [Mel]\nWatt[, the African-American incumbent who represented\nDistrict 12,] regarding options for re-drawing his district,”\nand that after this consultation, “the Chairs had the im-\npression that Congressman Watt would oppose any re-\ndrawing of the Twelfth District . . . as originally contem-\nplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.” Ibid.\n\f24                  COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nThe Chairs drew District 12 “[b]ased in part on this input\nfrom Congressman Watt.” Id., at 478–479. Two sentences\nlater in the same paragraph, the application observed that\nthe black voting age population for District 12 went up\nfrom 43.77% to 50.66% and that therefore the district\n“maintains, and in fact increases, the African-American\ncommunity’s ability to elect their candidate of choice in\nDistrict 12.” Id., at 479.\n   According to the majority, this statement shows a “de-\ntermination to concentrate black voters in District 12.”\nAnte, at 23. In fact, it shows no such thing. The state-\nment explains that Senator Rucho and Representative\nLewis decided not to construct District 12 as a majority-\nminority district—as the 1992 Justice Department had\ndemanded—“[b]ased in part on” the input they received\nfrom Congressman Watt, whom they thought “would\noppose” drawing the district “as originally contemplated\nby the 1992 Justice Department objection.” App. 478–479.\nIf anything, this document cuts against a finding of racial\npredominance.\n   The statement’s matter-of-fact reference to the increase\nin District 12’s black voting age population hardly shows\nthat the legislature altered District 12 for the purpose of\ncausing this increase. An entirely natural interpretation\nis that the Redistricting Chairs simply reported this fact\nso that it would be before the Justice Department in the\nevent that the Department had renewed Voting Rights Act\nconcerns. Only by reading a great deal between the lines\nand adopting the most sinister possible interpretation can\nthe statement be viewed as pointed evidence of a predomi-\nnantly racial motive.\n                          3\n               The Mel Watt Testimony\n  In both the District Court and the state trial court,\nCongressman Watt testified that, while the redistricting\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U.

Id.,\nat 2368–2369, 1343–1344. According to Congressman\nWatt, Senator Rucho said that the Republican leadership\nwanted him to “ramp the 12th Congressional District up to\nover 50 percent black” because “they believed it was re-\nquired . . . by the Voting Rights Act.” Id., at 1344, 2369,\n2393. In the state proceedings, Senator Rucho denied\nmaking any such statement, id., at 1703, and another\nstate legislator present at the meeting, Representative\nRuth Samuelson, gave similar testimony, id., at 1698.\nNeither Senator Rucho nor Representative Samuelson\ntestified in federal court (although their state court testi-\nmony was made part of the federal record). See id., at\n2847. But the District Court credited Congressman Watt’s\ntestimony based on its assessment of his demeanor and\nthe consistency of his recollection, 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 617–\n618, and I accept that credibility finding for purposes of\nour review.18\n   But even assuming that Congressman Watt’s recollec-\ntion was completely accurate, all that his testimony shows\nis that legislative leaders at one point in the process\n\n——————\n  18 That   being said, Congressman Watt’s testimony was double-\nhearsay: Congressman Watt testified about what Senator Rucho said\nsomeone else said. See App. 1345 (state trial court evidentiary ruling).\nFor unknown reasons, Appellants failed to raise this objection below,\nbut that only means that the testimony was admitted. The weight of\nthat testimony is a different matter, and in general, hearsay should be\nviewed with great skepticism. Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Pet. 412, 436 (1836)\n(majority opinion of Story, J.) (hearsay is “exceedingly infirm, unsatis-\nfactory and intrinsically weak in its very nature and character”); Queen\nv. Hepburn, 7 Cranch 290, 296 (1813) (majority opinion of Marshall,\nC. J.) (“Its intrinsic weakness, its incompetency to satisfy the mind of\nthe existence of the fact, and the frauds which might be practiced under\nits cover, combine to support the rule that hearsay evidence is totally\ninadmissible”); see also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 298\n(1973).\n\f26                  COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthought that they had to draw District 12 as a majority-\nminority district in order to comply with the Voting Rights\nAct; it does not show that they actually did draw District\n12 with the goal of creating a majority-minority district.\nAnd as explained in the discussion of the preclearance\nrequest above, Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis\nstated that they ultimately turned away from the creation\nof a majority-minority district after consulting with Con-\ngressman Watt. “Based in part on this input from Con-\ngressman Watt,” they said they decided not to draw the\ndistrict as the 1992 Department of Justice had suggested—\nthat is, as a majority-minority district. App. 478–479.\n   This account is fully consistent with Congressman\nWatt’s testimony about his meeting with Senator Rucho.\nCongressman Watt noted that Senator Rucho was uncom-\nfortable with the notion of increasing the black voting age\npopulation, id., at 2369, 2393, and Congressman Watt\ntestified that he told Senator Rucho that he was opposed\nto the idea, id., at 1345, 2369, 2393. So it makes sense\nthat Senator Rucho was dissuaded from taking that course\nby Congressman Watt’s reaction. And Dr. Hofeller con-\nsistently testified that he was never asked to meet a par-\nticular black voting age population target, see Part III–C–\n5, infra, and that the only data displayed on his screen\nwhen he drew District 12 was political data. See infra, at\n27, n. 19. Thus, Congressman Watt’s testimony, even if\ntaken at face value, is entirely consistent with what the\npreclearance request recounts: After initially contemplat-\ning the possibility of drawing District 12 as a majority-\nminority district, the legislative leadership met with\nCongressman Watt, who convinced them not to do so.\n                           4\n    Dr. Hofeller’s Statements About Guilford County\n Under the prior map, both Guilford County and the\nGreensboro African-American community were divided\n\f                       Cite as: 581 U.

This had been done,\nDr. Hofeller explained, “to make both the Old 12th and\n13th Districts strongly Democratic.” App. 1103; see also\nid., at 555, 2821; 1 Record 132–133 (showing racial de-\nmographics of Guilford precincts under 2001 and 2011\nmaps). But the Republican legislature wanted to make\nthe area surrounding District 12 more Republican. The\nnew map eliminated the old 13th District and created a\nnew district bearing that number farther to the east. The\nterritory to the north of Greensboro that had previously\nbeen in the 13th District was placed in a new district,\nDistrict 6, which was constructed to be a Republican-\nfriendly district, and the new map moved more of the\nGreensboro area into the new District 12. This move was\nentirely consistent with the legislature’s stated goal of\nconcentrating Democrats in the 12th District and mak-\ning the surrounding districts hospitable to Republican\ncandidates.\n   Dr. Hofeller testified that the placement of the Greens-\nboro African-American community in the 12th District\nwas the result of this political strategy. He stated that the\nportion of Guilford County absorbed by District 12 “wasn’t\nmoved into CD 12 because it had a substantial black\npopulation. It was moved into CD 12 because it had a\nsubstantial Democratic political voting record . . . .” App.\n2824. And Dr. Hofeller maintained that he was never\ninstructed to draw District 12 as a majority-minority\ndistrict or to increase the district’s black voting age popu-\nlation. See, e.g., id., at 520, 556–558, 1099, 1603–1604,\n2682–2683, 2789. Instead, he testified that political con-\nsiderations determined the boundaries of District 12 and\nthat the only data displayed on his computer screen when\nhe drew the challenged map was voting data from the\n2008 Presidential election.19 Id., at 1149, 2697, 2721–\n——————\n 19 Significantly,   while the District Court doubted Dr. Hofeller’s con-\n\f28                        COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                           Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n2722.\n    Dr. Hofeller acknowledged, however, that there had\nbeen concern about the possibility of a Voting Rights Act\nchallenge to this treatment of the Greensboro African-\nAmerican community. Guilford County was covered by §5\nof the Voting Rights Act, and as noted, §5 prohibits retro-\ngression. Under the old map, the Guilford County African-\nAmerican community was split between the old District 13\nand District 12, and in both of those districts, black voters\nwere able to elect the candidates of their choice by allying\nwith white Democratic voters. Under the new map, how-\never, if the Greensboro black community had been split\nbetween District 12 and the new Republican-friendly\nDistrict 6, the black voters in the latter district would be\nunlikely to elect the candidate of their choice. Placing the\nAfrican-American community in District 12 avoided this\nconsequence. Even Congressman Watt conceded that\nthere were potential §5 concerns relating to the black\ncommunity in Guilford County. Id., at 2387–2388.\n    The thrust of many of Dr. Hofeller’s statements about\nthe treatment of Guilford County was that the reuniting of\nthe Greensboro black community in District 12 was noth-\ning more than a welcome byproduct of his political strat-\negy. He testified that he first drew the district based on\npolitical considerations and then checked to ensure that\nGuilford County’s black population was not fractured. Id.,\nat 2822 (“[W]hen we checked it, we found that we did not\nhave an issue in Guilford County with fracturing the black\n. . . community”); see also id., at 556, 2821, 2823. This\ntestimony is entirely innocuous.\n——————\ntention that politics, not race, dictated the boundaries of District 12 and\nthat Dr. Hofeller was unaware of the relevant racial demographics in\nthe region, see 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 619–620, and n. 8, it did not dispute\nthat only political data was displayed on his screen when he drew the\ndistrict. The state trial court expressly found that only political data\nwas displayed on Dr. Hofeller’s screen. See App. 2150 (Finding 188).\n\f                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           29\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Hofeller also made\na few statements that may be read to imply that concern\nabout Voting Rights Act litigation was part of the motiva-\ntion for the treatment of Guilford County. He testified at\ntrial that he “was instructed [not] to use race in any form\nexcept perhaps with regard to Guilford County.” Id., at\n2791 (emphasis added). See id., at 1103 (the legislature\n“determined that it was prudent to reunify the African-\nAmerican community in Guilford County”); id., at 558\n(“[I]t was decided to reunite the black community in Guil-\nford County into the Twelfth”).\n   These statements by Dr. Hofeller convinced the District\nCourt that the drawing of District 12 was not a “purely . . .\npolitically driven affair.” 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 619. But in\norder to prevail, the plaintiffs had to show much more—\nthat race was the predominant reason for the drawing of\nDistrict 12, and these few bits of testimony fall far short of\nthat showing.\n   Our decision in Cromartie II illustrates this point. In\nthat case, the legislature’s mapmaker made a statement\nthat is remarkably similar to Dr. Hofeller’s. Gerry Cohen,\nthe “legislative staff member responsible for drafting\ndistricting plans,” reported: “ ‘I have moved Greensboro\nBlack community into the 12th, and now need to take\n[about] 60,000 out of the 12th. I await your direction on\nthis.’ ” 532 U. S., at 254. This admission did not persuade\nthe Court that the legislature’s predominant motive was\nracial. The majority ignores this obvious parallel with\nCromartie II.\n   Moreover, in an attempt to magnify the importance of\nthe treatment of Guilford County, the majority plays\ngames with statistics. It states that “District 12 saw a net\nincrease of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford\nCounty, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across\nthe district: So the newly added parts of that county\nplayed a major role in pushing the district’s BVAP over\n\f30                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n50%.” Ante, at 26.\n   This is highly misleading. First, since the black voting\nage population of District 12 is just barely over 50%—\nspecifically, 50.66%—almost any decision that increased\nthe number of voting age blacks in District 12 could be\nsaid to have “played a major role in pushing the district’s\nBVAP over 50%.”\n   Second, the majority provides the total number of voting\nage blacks added to District 12 from Guilford County\n(approximately 25,000) alongside the total number of\nvoting age blacks added to the district (approximately\n35,000), and this has the effect of making Guilford County\nlook like it is the overwhelming contributor to the dis-\ntrict’s net increase in black voting age population. In\ntruth, Mecklenburg County was by far the greatest con-\ntributor of voting age blacks to District 12 in both absolute\nterms (approximately 147,000) and in terms of new voting\nage blacks (approximately 37,000). See App. 384, 500–\n502. Indeed, if what matters to the majority is how much\nindividual counties increased District 12’s black voting age\npopulation percentage, Davidson County deserves atten-\ntion as well, since the portion of the county within District\n12 lost over 26,000 more voting age whites than blacks.\nIbid. That is greater than the net number of voting age\nblacks added to the district by Guilford County or Meck-\nlenburg County. Ibid. As with so much in the majority\nopinion, the issue here is more nuanced—and much more\nfavorable to the State—than the majority would have it\nseem.\n                             5\n               The July 1, 2011, Statement\n  For reasons similar to those just explained, the majority\nmakes far too much of a statement issued by Senator\nRucho and Representative Lewis on July 1, 2011, when\nthe new districting plan was proposed. Particularly in\n\f                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)          31\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nlight of Dr. Hofeller’s later testimony about the legisla-\nture’s partisan objectives, it is apparent that this state-\nment does not paint an entirely reliable picture of the\nlegislature’s aims. The statement begins with this proc-\nlamation: “From the beginning, our goal has remained the\nsame: the development of fair and legal congressional and\nlegislative districts,” id., at 353, and the statement seri-\nously downplays the role of politics in the map-drawing\nprocess, acknowledging only that “we have not been igno-\nrant of the partisan impacts of the districts we have\ncreated,” id., at 361.\n   The statement discusses the treatment of Guilford\nCounty in a section with the heading “Compliance with\nthe Voting Rights Act.” Id., at 355–358. In that section,\nRucho and Lewis state: “Because of the presence of Guil-\nford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our\nproposed Twelfth District at a black voting age level that\nis above the percentage of black voting age population\nfound in the current Twelfth District. We believe that this\nmeasure will ensure preclearance of the plan.” Id., at 358.\n   The majority and the District Court interpret this pas-\nsage to say that Rucho and Lewis decided to move black\nvoters from Guilford County into District 12 in order to\nward off Voting Rights Act liability. Ante, at 22 (“Because\nof the VRA, [Rucho and Lewis] increased the number of\nAfrican-Americans” in District 12 (citing 159 F. Supp. 3d,\nat 617; emphasis in original)). But that is hardly the only\nplausible interpretation. The statement could just as\neasily be understood as “an explanation by [the] legisla-\nture that because they chose to add Guilford County back\ninto CD 12, the district ended up with an increased ability\nto elect African-American candidates, rather than the\nlegislature explaining that they chose to add Guilford\nCounty back into CD 12 because of the [racial] results that\naddition created.” Id., at 635 (Osteen, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original). And\n\f32                    COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nbecause we are obligated to presume the good faith of the\nNorth Carolina Legislature, this latter interpretation is\nthe appropriate one.\n   But even if one adopts the majority’s interpretation, it\nadds little to the analysis. The majority’s close and in-\ncriminating reading of a statement issued to win public\nsupport for the new plan may represent poetic justice:\nHaving attempted to blur the partisan aim of the new\nDistrict 12, the legislature is hoisted on its own petard.\nBut poetic justice is not the type of justice that we are\nsupposed to dispense. This statement is some evidence\nthat race played a role in the drawing of District 12, but it\nis a mistake to give this political statement too much\nweight.\n   Again, we made precisely this point in Cromartie II.\nThere, the “legislative redistricting leader,” then-Senator\nRoy Cooper, testified before a legislative committee that\nthe proposed plan “ ‘provides for . . . racial and partisan\nbalance.’ ” 532 U. S., at 253 (emphasis added). The Dis-\ntrict Court read the statement literally and concluded that\nthe district had been drawn with a racial objective. Ibid.\nBut this Court dismissed the statement, reasoning that\nalthough “the phrase shows that the legislature consid-\nered race, along with other partisan and geographic con-\nsiderations; . . . it says little or nothing about whether race\nplayed a predominant role comparatively speaking.” Ibid.\n   What was good in Cromartie II should also be good here.\n                              6\n               Dr. Ansolabehere’s Testimony\n  Finally, the majority cites Dr. Ansolabehere’s testimony\nthat black registered voters in the counties covered by\nDistrict 12 were more likely to be drawn into District 12\nthan white registered voters and that black registered\nDemocrats were more likely to be pulled in than white\nregistered Democrats. Ante, at 26–27.\n\f                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   33\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   There is an obvious flaw in Dr. Ansolabehere’s analysis.\nHe assumed that, if race was not the driving force behind\nthe drawing of District 12, “white and black registered\nvoters would have approximately the same likelihood of\ninclusion in a given Congressional District.” App. 2597\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But that would be\ntrue only if black and white voters were evenly distributed\nthroughout the region, and his own maps showed that this\nwas not so. See id., at 322–328; 1 Record 128–133. Black\nvoters were concentrated in the cities located at the north\nand south ends of the district and constituted a superma-\njority of Democrats in the area covered by District 12. See\nPart III–B, supra. As long as the basic shape of the dis-\ntrict was retained, moving Democrats from areas outside\nbut close to the old district boundaries naturally picked up\nfar more black Democrats than white Democrats.\n   This explanation eluded Dr. Ansolabehere because he\nrefused to consider either the implications of the political\nstrategy that the legislature claimed to have pursued or\nthe effects of the changes to District 12 on the surrounding\ndistricts. App. 2578–2582. The result was a distorted—\nand largely useless—analysis.\n                             IV\n  Reviewing the evidence outlined above,20 two themes\nemerge. First, District 12’s borders and racial composition\nare readily explained by political considerations and the\neffects of the legislature’s political strategy on the de-\nmographics of District 12. Second, the majority largely\nignores this explanation, as did the court below, and in-\nstead adopts the most damning interpretation of all avail-\nable evidence.\n  Both of these analytical maneuvers violate our clearly\n\n——————\n   20 The District Court relied on other evidence as well, but its proba-\n\ntive value is so weak that even the majority does not cite it.\n\f34                   COOPER v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nestablished precedent. Our cases say that we must “ ‘exer-\ncise extraordinary caution’ ” “ ‘where the State has articu-\nlated a legitimate political explanation for its districting\ndecision,’ ” Cromartie II, supra, at 242 (emphasis deleted);\nthe majority ignores that political explanation. Our cases\nsay that “the good faith of a state legislature must be\npresumed,” Miller, 515 U. S., at 915; the majority pre-\nsumes the opposite. And Cromartie II held that plaintiffs\nin a case like this are obligated to produce a map showing\nthat the legislature could have achieved its political objec-\ntives without the racial effect seen in the challenged plan;\nhere, the majority junks that rule and says that the plain-\ntiffs’ failure to produce such a map simply “does not mat-\nter.” Ante, at 30.\n   The judgment below regarding District 12 should be\nreversed, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\f",
