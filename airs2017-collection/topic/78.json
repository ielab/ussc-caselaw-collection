He has lived\nin prison under threat of execution for 40 years. When\nhe was first sentenced to death, the Berlin Wall stood\nfirmly in place. Saigon had just fallen. Few Americans\nknew of the personal computer or the Internet. And over\nhalf of all Americans now alive had not yet been born.

Kutler ed., 3d ed. 2003). This Court, speaking of a\nperiod of four weeks, not 40 years, once said that a prison-\ner’s uncertainty before execution is “one of the most horri-\nble feelings to which he can be subjected.” In re Medley,\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92716\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/92716/medley/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e134\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e160\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 172 (1890).
