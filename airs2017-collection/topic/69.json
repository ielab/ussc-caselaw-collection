Rev.\n949, 1001 (2010). This Court’s statements about the com-\nparative breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause are of\nquestionable relevance where the issue is Congress’ power\nto regulate, or even criminalize, conduct within another\nnation’s sovereign territory.\n  Moreover, this Court’s comparative statements about\nthe breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause have relied\non some “evidence that the Founders intended the scope of\nthe foreign commerce power to be greater” than Congress’\npower to regulate commerce among the States. Japan\nLine, supra, at 448. Whatever the Founders’ intentions\nmight have been in this respect, they were grounded in the\noriginal understanding of the Interstate Commerce\nClause. But this Court’s modern doctrine has “drifted far\nfrom the original understanding.” Lopez, supra, at 584\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). For one thing, the “Clause’s\ntext, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of\nthe founding, the term ‘ “commerce” consisted of selling,\nbuying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these\npurposes.’ ” Raich, 545 U. S., at 58 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Lopez, supra, at 585 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)).\nFor another, “the very notion of a ‘substantial effects’ test\nunder the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the origi-\nnal understanding of Congress’ powers and with this\nCourt’s early Commerce Clause cases.” United States\nv. Morrison, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e529\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e598\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 627 (2000) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring).\n  Thus, even if the foreign commerce power were broader\nthan the interstate commerce power as understood at the\nfounding, it would not follow that the foreign commerce\npower is broader than the interstate commerce power as\nthis Court now construes it. But rather than interpreting\nthe Foreign Commerce Clause as it was originally under-\nstood, the courts of appeals have taken this Court’s mod-\nern interstate commerce doctrine and assumed that the\n\u000c6                BASTON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nforeign commerce power is at least as broad. The result is\na doctrine justified neither by our precedents nor by the\noriginal understanding.\n                             B\n  Taken to the limits of its logic, the consequences of the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning are startling. The Foreign\nCommerce Clause would permit Congress to regulate any\neconomic activity anywhere in the world, so long as Con-\ngress had a rational basis to conclude that the activity has\na substantial effect on commerce between this Nation and\nany other. Congress would be able not only to criminalize\nprostitution in Australia, but also to regulate working\nconditions in factories in China, pollution from power-\nplants in India, or agricultural methods on farms in\nFrance. I am confident that whatever the correct interpre-\ntation of the foreign commerce power may be, it does not\nconfer upon Congress a virtually plenary power over\nglobal economic activity.\n                         *   *     *\n  We should grant certiorari in this case to consider the\nproper scope of Congress’ Foreign Commerce Clause power.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\u000c\u003c/pre\u003e",

S. 279, 290 (1904)\n(“[T]he power to regulate commerce with foreign nations\n. . . includes the entrance of ships, the importation of\ngoods, and the bringing of persons into the ports of the\nUnited States”). This Court has also articulated limits on\nthe power of the States to regulate commerce with foreign\nnations under the so-called dormant Foreign Commerce\nClause. See, e.g., Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Ange-\nles, 441 U. S. 434, 449–454 (1979). We have not, however,\nconsidered the limits of Congress’ power under the Clause\nto regulate conduct occurring entirely within the jurisdic-\ntion of a foreign sovereign.\n    In the absence of specific guidance, the courts of ap-\npeals—including the court below—have understandably\nextended this Court’s Interstate Commerce Clause prece-\ndents abroad. In United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549,\n558–559 (1995), we held that Congress is limited to regu-\nlating three categories of interstate activity: “the use of\nthe channels of interstate commerce,” “the instrumentali-\nties of interstate commerce,” and “activities that substan-\ntially affect interstate commerce.” Some courts of appeals\n“have imported the Lopez categories directly into the\n\u000c4                BASTON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nforeign context,” some “have applied Lopez generally but\nrecognized that Congress has greater power to regulate\nforeign commerce,” and others have gone further still,\n“holding that Congress has authority to legislate under\nthe Foreign Commerce Clause when the text of a statute\nhas a constitutionally tenable nexus with foreign com-\nmerce.” United States v. Bollinger, 798 F. 3d 201, 215\n(CA4 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nid., at 215–216 (“Instead of requiring that an activity have\na substantial effect on foreign commerce, we hold that the\nForeign Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate\nactivities that demonstrably affect such commerce”).\n                             III\n  I am concerned that language in some of this Court’s\nprecedents has led the courts of appeals into error. At the\nvery least, the time has come for us to clarify the scope of\nCongress’ power under the Foreign Commerce Clause to\nregulate extraterritorially.\n                              A\n   The courts of appeals have relied upon statements by\nthis Court comparing the foreign commerce power to the\ninterstate commerce power, but have removed those\nstatements from their context. In certain contexts, this\nCourt has described the foreign commerce power as “ex-\nclusive and plenary,” Board of Trustees, supra, at 56–57\n(citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196–200 (1824)),\nexplaining that Congress’ commerce power “when exer-\ncised in respect of foreign commerce may be broader than\nwhen exercised as to interstate commerce,” Atlantic\nCleaners \u0026 Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 434\n(1932); see also Brolan v. United States, 236 U. S. 216,\n218–220 (1915). None of these opinions, however, “in-\nvolve[d] legislation of extraterritorial operation which\npurports to regulate conduct inside foreign nations.”\n\u000c                  Cite as: 580 U. S. ____ (2017)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nColangelo, The Foreign Commerce Clause, 96 Va. L. Rev.\n949, 1001 (2010). This Court’s statements about the com-\nparative breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause are of\nquestionable relevance where the issue is Congress’ power\nto regulate, or even criminalize, conduct within another\nnation’s sovereign territory.\n  Moreover, this Court’s comparative statements about\nthe breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause have relied\non some “evidence that the Founders intended the scope of\nthe foreign commerce power to be greater” than Congress’\npower to regulate commerce among the States. Japan\nLine, supra, at 448. Whatever the Founders’ intentions\nmight have been in this respect, they were grounded in the\noriginal understanding of the Interstate Commerce\nClause. But this Court’s modern doctrine has “drifted far\nfrom the original understanding.” Lopez, supra, at 584\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). For one thing, the “Clause’s\ntext, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of\nthe founding, the term ‘ “commerce” consisted of selling,\nbuying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these\npurposes.’ ” Raich, 545 U. S., at 58 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (quoting Lopez, supra, at 585 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)).\nFor another, “the very notion of a ‘substantial effects’ test\nunder the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the origi-\nnal understanding of Congress’ powers and with this\nCourt’s early Commerce Clause cases.” United States\nv. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 627 (2000) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring).\n  Thus, even if the foreign commerce power were broader\nthan the interstate commerce power as understood at the\nfounding, it would not follow that the foreign commerce\npower is broader than the interstate commerce power as\nthis Court now construes it. But rather than interpreting\nthe Foreign Commerce Clause as it was originally under-\nstood, the courts of appeals have taken this Court’s mod-\nern interstate commerce doctrine and assumed that the\n\u000c6                BASTON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nforeign commerce power is at least as broad. The result is\na doctrine justified neither by our precedents nor by the\noriginal understanding.\n                             B\n  Taken to the limits of its logic, the consequences of the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning are startling. The Foreign\nCommerce Clause would permit Congress to regulate any\neconomic activity anywhere in the world, so long as Con-\ngress had a rational basis to conclude that the activity has\na substantial effect on commerce between this Nation and\nany other. Congress would be able not only to criminalize\nprostitution in Australia, but also to regulate working\nconditions in factories in China, pollution from power-\nplants in India, or agricultural methods on farms in\nFrance. I am confident that whatever the correct interpre-\ntation of the foreign commerce power may be, it does not\nconfer upon Congress a virtually plenary power over\nglobal economic activity.\n                         *   *     *\n  We should grant certiorari in this case to consider the\nproper scope of Congress’ Foreign Commerce Clause power.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\u000c",
