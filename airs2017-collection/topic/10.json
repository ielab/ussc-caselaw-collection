CLARKE\n\n    CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CONNECTICUT\n\n    No. 15–1500. Argued January 9, 2017—Decided April 25, 2017\nPetitioners Brian and Michelle Lewis were driving on a Connecticut\n  interstate when they were struck from behind by a vehicle driven by\n  respondent William Clarke, a Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority\n  employee, who was transporting Mohegan Sun Casino patrons. The\n  Lewises sued Clarke in his individual capacity in state court. Clarke\n  moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that\n  because he was an employee of the Gaming Authority—an arm of the\n  Mohegan Tribe entitled to sovereign immunity—and was acting with-\n  in the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, he was\n  similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit. He also ar-\n  gued, in the alternative, that he should prevail because the Gaming\n  Authority was bound by tribal law to indemnify him. The trial court\n  denied Clarke’s motion, but the Supreme Court of Connecticut re-\n  versed, holding that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit be-\n  cause Clarke was acting within the scope of his employment when\n  the accident occurred. It did not consider whether Clarke should be\n  entitled to sovereign immunity based on the indemnification statute.\nHeld:\n    1. In a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual ca-\n pacity, the employee, not the tribe, is the real party in interest and\n the tribe’s sovereign immunity is not implicated. Pp. 5–8.\n       (a) In the context of lawsuits against state and federal employ-\n ees or entities, courts look to whether the sovereign is the real party\n in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit,\n see Hafer v.

But an officer in an individual-capacity action—\n\u000c2                            LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    which seeks “to impose individual liability upon a government officer\n    for actions taken under color of state law,” Hafer, 502 U. S., at 25—\n    may be able to assert personal immunity defenses but not sovereign\n    immunity, id., at 30–31. The Court does not reach Clarke’s argument\n    that he is entitled to the personal immunity defense of official im-\n    munity, which Clarke raised for the first time on appeal. Pp. 5–7.\n          (b) Applying these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign\n    immunity, it is apparent that they foreclose Clarke’s sovereign im-\n    munity defense. This action arises from a tort committed by Clarke\n    on a Connecticut interstate and is simply a suit against Clarke to re-\n    cover for his personal actions. Clarke, not the Gaming Authority, is\n    the real party in interest. The State Supreme Court extended sover-\n    eign immunity for tribal employees beyond what common-law sover-\n    eign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal\n    employees. Pp. 7–8.\n       2. An indemnification provision cannot, as a matter of law, extend\n    sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not\n    fall under its protective cloak. Pp. 8–12.\n          (a) This conclusion follows naturally from the principles dis-\n    cussed above and previously applied to the different question wheth-\n    er a state instrumentality may invoke the State’s immunity from suit\n    even when the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify that in-\n    strumentality against adverse judgments, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\n    Doe, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118087\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/118087/regents-of-univ-of-cal-v-doe/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e519\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e425\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e. There, this Court held that the indemnification\n    provision did not divest the state instrumentality of Eleventh\n    Amendment immunity, and its analysis turned on where the poten-\n    tial legal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the damages\n    award ultimately came. Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no ju-\n    risdiction over the Tribe or Gaming Authority, and their judgments\n    will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in any way. Moreover,\n    indemnification is not a certainty, because Clarke will not be indem-\n    nified should the Gaming Authority determine that he engaged in\n    “wanton, reckless, or malicious” activity. Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n          (b) Courts have extended sovereign immunity to private\n    healthcare insurance companies under certain circumstances, but\n    those cases rest on the proposition that the fiscal intermediaries are\n    essentially state instrumentalities, and Clarke offers no persuasive\n    reason to depart from precedent and treat a lawsuit against an indi-\n    vidual employee as one against a state instrumentality.

This Court has considered the scope of that immu-\nnity in a number of circumstances. This case presents an\nordinary negligence action brought against a tribal em-\nployee in state court under state law. We granted certio-\nrari to resolve whether an Indian tribe’s sovereign immu-\nnity bars individual-capacity damages actions against tribal\nemployees for torts committed within the scope of their\nemployment and for which the employees are indemnified\nby the tribe.\n  We hold that, in a suit brought against a tribal employee\nin his individual capacity, the employee, not the tribe, is\nthe real party in interest and the tribe’s sovereign immu-\nnity is not implicated. That an employee was acting within\nthe scope of his employment at the time the tort was\ncommitted is not, on its own, sufficient to bar a suit\nagainst that employee on the basis of tribal sovereign\nimmunity. We hold further that an indemnification provi-\nsion does not extend a tribe’s sovereign immunity where it\notherwise would not reach. Accordingly, we reverse and\n\u000c2                        LEWIS v.

CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargued that because the Gaming Authority, an arm of the\nTribe, was entitled to sovereign immunity, he, an employee\nof the Gaming Authority acting within the scope of his\nemployment at the time of the accident, was similarly\nentitled to sovereign immunity against suit. According to\nClarke, denying the motion would abrogate the Tribe’s\nsovereign immunity.\n   The trial court denied Clarke’s motion to dismiss. Id., at\n*8. The court agreed with the Lewises that the sovereign\nimmunity analysis should focus on the remedy sought in\ntheir complaint. To that end, the court identified Clarke,\nnot the Gaming Authority or the Tribe, as the real party in\ninterest because the damages remedy sought was solely\nagainst Clarke and would in no way affect the Tribe’s\nability to govern itself independently. The court therefore\nconcluded that tribal sovereign immunity was not impli-\ncated. Id., at *2–*8. It also rejected Clarke’s alternative\nargument that because the Gaming Authority was obligated\nto indemnify him pursuant to Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52\nand would end up paying the damages, he should prevail\nunder the remedy analysis. Id., at *7.

In\nmaking this assessment, courts may not simply rely on the\ncharacterization of the parties in the complaint, but rather\nmust determine in the first instance whether the remedy\nsought is truly against the sovereign. See, e.g., Ex parte\n\u000c6                     LEWIS v.

If, for example,\nan action is in essence against a State even if the State is\nnot a named party, then the State is the real party in\ninterest and is entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amend-\nment’s protection. For this reason, an arm or instrumen-\ntality of the State generally enjoys the same immunity as\nthe sovereign itself. E.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.

It is apparent\nthat these general principles foreclose Clarke’s sovereign\nimmunity defense in this case. This is a negligence action\narising from a tort committed by Clarke on an interstate\nhighway within the State of Connecticut. The suit is\nbrought against a tribal employee operating a vehicle\nwithin the scope of his employment but on state lands, and\nthe judgment will not operate against the Tribe. This is\nnot a suit against Clarke in his official capacity. It is\nsimply a suit against Clarke to recover for his personal\nactions, which “will not require action by the sovereign or\ndisturb the sovereign’s property.” Larson v.

We\nare cognizant of the Supreme Court of Connecticut’s con-\ncern that plaintiffs not circumvent tribal sovereign im-\nmunity. But here, that immunity is simply not in play.\nClarke, not the Gaming Authority, is the real party in\ninterest.\n  In ruling that Clarke was immune from this suit solely\nbecause he was acting within the scope of his employment,\nthe court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employ-\nees beyond what common-law sovereign immunity princi-\n\u000c8                         LEWIS v.

The protection\noffered by tribal sovereign immunity here is no broader\nthan the protection offered by state or federal sovereign\nimmunity.\n  Accordingly, under established sovereign immunity\nprinciples, the Gaming Authority’s immunity does not, in\nthese circumstances, bar suit against Clarke.2\n                            III\n  The conclusion above notwithstanding, Clarke argues\nthat the Gaming Authority is the real party in interest\nhere because it is required by Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52\nto indemnify Clarke for any adverse judgment.3\n                            A\n  We have never before had occasion to decide whether an\nindemnification clause is sufficient to extend a sovereign\nimmunity defense to a suit against an employee in his\nindividual capacity.

We nevertheless consider the issue\nfairly included within the question presented, as it is a purely legal\nquestion that is an integral part of Clarke’s sovereign immunity argu-\nment and that was both raised to and passed on by the trial court.

Indeed, we have applied these same princi-\nples to a different question before—whether a state in-\nstrumentality may invoke the State’s immunity from suit\neven when the Federal Government has agreed to indem-\nnify that instrumentality against adverse judgments. In\nRegents of Univ. of Cal., an individual brought suit against\nthe University of California, a public university of the State\nof California, for breach of contract related to his employ-\nment at a laboratory operated by the university pursuant\nto a contract with the Federal Government. We held that\nthe indemnification provision did not divest the state\ninstrumentality of Eleventh Amendment immunity. 519\nU. S., at 426. Our analysis turned on where the potential\nlegal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the\ndamages award ultimately came. Because the lawsuit\nbound the university, we held, the Eleventh Amendment\napplied to the litigation even though the damages award\nwould ultimately be paid by the federal Department of\nEnergy. Id., at 429–431. Our reasoning remains the\nsame. The critical inquiry is who may be legally bound by\nthe court’s adverse judgment, not who will ultimately pick\nup the tab.4\n  Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no jurisdiction\nover the Tribe or the Gaming Authority, and their judg-\nments will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in\n——————\n   4 Our holding in Hess v.

Moreover, indemnification is not a certainty\nhere. Clarke will not be indemnified by the Gaming Au-\nthority should it determine that he engaged in “wanton,\nreckless, or malicious” activity.

Argued January 9, 2017—Decided April 25, 2017\nPetitioners Brian and Michelle Lewis were driving on a Connecticut\n  interstate when they were struck from behind by a vehicle driven by\n  respondent William Clarke, a Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority\n  employee, who was transporting Mohegan Sun Casino patrons. The\n  Lewises sued Clarke in his individual capacity in state court. Clarke\n  moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that\n  because he was an employee of the Gaming Authority—an arm of the\n  Mohegan Tribe entitled to sovereign immunity—and was acting with-\n  in the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, he was\n  similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit. He also ar-\n  gued, in the alternative, that he should prevail because the Gaming\n  Authority was bound by tribal law to indemnify him. The trial court\n  denied Clarke’s motion, but the Supreme Court of Connecticut re-\n  versed, holding that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit be-\n  cause Clarke was acting within the scope of his employment when\n  the accident occurred. It did not consider whether Clarke should be\n  entitled to sovereign immunity based on the indemnification statute.\nHeld:\n    1. In a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual ca-\n pacity, the employee, not the tribe, is the real party in interest and\n the tribe’s sovereign immunity is not implicated. Pp. 5–8.\n       (a) In the context of lawsuits against state and federal employ-\n ees or entities, courts look to whether the sovereign is the real party\n in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit,\n see Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25. A defendant in an official-\n capacity action—where the relief sought is only nominally against\n the official and in fact is against the official’s office and thus the sov-\n ereign itself—may assert sovereign immunity. Kentucky v. Graham,\n 473 U. S. 159, 167. But an officer in an individual-capacity action—\n\u000c2                            LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    which seeks “to impose individual liability upon a government officer\n    for actions taken under color of state law,” Hafer, 502 U. S., at 25—\n    may be able to assert personal immunity defenses but not sovereign\n    immunity, id., at 30–31. The Court does not reach Clarke’s argument\n    that he is entitled to the personal immunity defense of official im-\n    munity, which Clarke raised for the first time on appeal. Pp. 5–7.\n          (b) Applying these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign\n    immunity, it is apparent that they foreclose Clarke’s sovereign im-\n    munity defense. This action arises from a tort committed by Clarke\n    on a Connecticut interstate and is simply a suit against Clarke to re-\n    cover for his personal actions. Clarke, not the Gaming Authority, is\n    the real party in interest. The State Supreme Court extended sover-\n    eign immunity for tribal employees beyond what common-law sover-\n    eign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal\n    employees. Pp. 7–8.\n       2. An indemnification provision cannot, as a matter of law, extend\n    sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not\n    fall under its protective cloak. Pp. 8–12.\n          (a) This conclusion follows naturally from the principles dis-\n    cussed above and previously applied to the different question wheth-\n    er a state instrumentality may invoke the State’s immunity from suit\n    even when the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify that in-\n    strumentality against adverse judgments, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\n    Doe, 519 U. S. 425. There, this Court held that the indemnification\n    provision did not divest the state instrumentality of Eleventh\n    Amendment immunity, and its analysis turned on where the poten-\n    tial legal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the damages\n    award ultimately came. Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no ju-\n    risdiction over the Tribe or Gaming Authority, and their judgments\n    will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in any way. Moreover,\n    indemnification is not a certainty, because Clarke will not be indem-\n    nified should the Gaming Authority determine that he engaged in\n    “wanton, reckless, or malicious” activity. Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n          (b) Courts have extended sovereign immunity to private\n    healthcare insurance companies under certain circumstances, but\n    those cases rest on the proposition that the fiscal intermediaries are\n    essentially state instrumentalities, and Clarke offers no persuasive\n    reason to depart from precedent and treat a lawsuit against an indi-\n    vidual employee as one against a state instrumentality. Similarly,\n    this Court has never held that a civil rights suit under 42 U. S. C.\n    §1983 against a state officer in his individual capacity implicates the\n    Eleventh Amendment and a State’s sovereign immunity from suit.\n    Finally, this Court’s conclusion that indemnification provisions do not\n\u000c                    Cite as: 581 U.

This Court has considered the scope of that immu-\nnity in a number of circumstances. This case presents an\nordinary negligence action brought against a tribal em-\nployee in state court under state law. We granted certio-\nrari to resolve whether an Indian tribe’s sovereign immu-\nnity bars individual-capacity damages actions against tribal\nemployees for torts committed within the scope of their\nemployment and for which the employees are indemnified\nby the tribe.\n  We hold that, in a suit brought against a tribal employee\nin his individual capacity, the employee, not the tribe, is\nthe real party in interest and the tribe’s sovereign immu-\nnity is not implicated. That an employee was acting within\nthe scope of his employment at the time the tort was\ncommitted is not, on its own, sufficient to bar a suit\nagainst that employee on the basis of tribal sovereign\nimmunity. We hold further that an indemnification provi-\nsion does not extend a tribe’s sovereign immunity where it\notherwise would not reach. Accordingly, we reverse and\n\u000c2                        LEWIS v.

Fawcett, The Lasting of the Mohegans 7, 11–13 (1995).\nIn 1994, in accordance with the petition procedures estab-\nlished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Tribe attained\nfederal recognition.1 See 59 Fed. Reg. 12140 (1994);\nMohegan Const., Preamble and Art. II.\n   As one means of maintaining its economic self-\nsufficiency, the Tribe entered into a Gaming Compact with\nthe State of Connecticut pursuant to the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act, 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U. S. C. §2701 et seq.\nThe compact authorizes the Tribe to conduct gaming on its\nland, subject to certain conditions including establishment\nof the Gaming Disputes Court. See 59 Fed. Reg. 65130\n(approving the Tribal-State Compact Between the Mohe-\ngan Indian Tribe and the State of Connecticut (May 17,\n1994)); Mohegan Const., Art.

The Gam-\ning Authority has waived its sovereign immunity and\nconsented to be sued in the Mohegan Gaming Disputes\nCourt. Mohegan Const., Art. XIII, §1; Mohegan Tribe\nCode §3–250(b). Neither the Tribe nor the Gaming Au-\nthority has consented to suit for claims arising under\nConnecticut state law. See Mohegan Const., Art. IX, §2(t);\nMohegan Tribe Code §3–250(g); see also Blatchford v.\nNative Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 782 (1991) (ob-\nserving that Indian tribes have not surrendered their\nimmunity against suits by States). Further, Mohegan\nTribe Code §4–52 provides that the Gaming Authority\n“shall save harmless and indemnify its Officer or Em-\nployee from financial loss and expense arising out of any\nclaim, demand, or suit by reason of his or her alleged\nnegligence . . . if the Officer or Employee is found to have\nbeen acting in the discharge of his or her duties or within\nthe scope of his or her employment.” The Gaming Author-\nity does not indemnify employees who engage in “wanton,\nreckless or malicious” activity. Mohegan Tribe Code\n§4–52.\n                             B\n  Petitioners Brian and Michelle Lewis were driving down\nInterstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, when a limousine\ndriven by respondent William Clarke hit their vehicle\nfrom behind. Clarke, a Gaming Authority employee, was\ntransporting patrons of the Mohegan Sun Casino to their\nhomes. For purposes of this appeal, it is undisputed that\nClarke caused the accident.\n  The Lewises filed suit against Clarke in his individual\ncapacity in Connecticut state court, and Clarke moved to\ndismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the basis\nof tribal sovereign immunity. See 2014 WL 5354956, *2\n(Super. Ct. Conn., Sept. 10, 2014) (Cole-Chu, J.). Clarke\n\u000c4                     LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargued that because the Gaming Authority, an arm of the\nTribe, was entitled to sovereign immunity, he, an employee\nof the Gaming Authority acting within the scope of his\nemployment at the time of the accident, was similarly\nentitled to sovereign immunity against suit. According to\nClarke, denying the motion would abrogate the Tribe’s\nsovereign immunity.\n   The trial court denied Clarke’s motion to dismiss. Id., at\n*8. The court agreed with the Lewises that the sovereign\nimmunity analysis should focus on the remedy sought in\ntheir complaint. To that end, the court identified Clarke,\nnot the Gaming Authority or the Tribe, as the real party in\ninterest because the damages remedy sought was solely\nagainst Clarke and would in no way affect the Tribe’s\nability to govern itself independently. The court therefore\nconcluded that tribal sovereign immunity was not impli-\ncated. Id., at *2–*8. It also rejected Clarke’s alternative\nargument that because the Gaming Authority was obligated\nto indemnify him pursuant to Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52\nand would end up paying the damages, he should prevail\nunder the remedy analysis. Id., at *7. The trial court\nreasoned that a “voluntary undertaking cannot be used to\nextend sovereign immunity where it did not otherwise\nexist.” Ibid.\n   The Supreme Court of Connecticut reversed, holding\nthat tribal sovereign immunity did bar the suit. 320 Conn.\n706, 135 A. 3d 677 (2016). The court agreed with Clarke\nthat “because he was acting within the scope of his em-\nployment for the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority and\nthe Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority is an arm of the\nMohegan Tribe, tribal sovereign immunity bars the plain-\ntiffs’ claims against him.” Id., at 709, 135 A. 3d, at 680.\nOf particular significance to the court was ensuring that\n“plaintiffs cannot circumvent tribal immunity by merely\nnaming the defendant, an employee of the tribe, when the\ncomplaint concerns actions taken within the scope of his\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduties and the complaint does not allege, nor have the\nplaintiffs offered any other evidence, that he acted outside\nthe scope of his authority.” Id., at 720, 135 A. 3d, at 685.\nTo do otherwise, the court reasoned, would “ ‘eviscerate’ ”\nthe protections of tribal immunity. Id., at 717, 135 A. 3d,\nat 684 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nBecause the court determined that Clarke was entitled to\nsovereign immunity on the sole basis that he was acting\nwithin the scope of his employment when the accident\noccurred, id., at 720, 135 A. 3d, at 685–686, it did not\nconsider whether Clarke should be entitled to sovereign\nimmunity on the basis of the indemnification statute.\n  We granted certiorari to consider whether tribal sover-\neign immunity bars the Lewises’ suit against Clarke, 579\nU. S. ___ (2016), and we now reverse the judgment of the\nSupreme Court of Connecticut.\n                               II\n  Two issues require our resolution: (1) whether the sov-\nereign immunity of an Indian tribe bars individual-\ncapacity damages against tribal employees for torts com-\nmitted within the scope of their employment; and (2) what\nrole, if any, a tribe’s decision to indemnify its employees\nplays in this analysis. We decide this case under the\nframework of our precedents regarding tribal immunity.\n                             A\n  Our cases establish that, in the context of lawsuits\nagainst state and federal employees or entities, courts\nshould look to whether the sovereign is the real party in\ninterest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars\nthe suit. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25 (1991). In\nmaking this assessment, courts may not simply rely on the\ncharacterization of the parties in the complaint, but rather\nmust determine in the first instance whether the remedy\nsought is truly against the sovereign. See, e.g., Ex parte\n\u000c6                     LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNew York, 256 U. S. 490, 500–502 (1921). If, for example,\nan action is in essence against a State even if the State is\nnot a named party, then the State is the real party in\ninterest and is entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amend-\nment’s protection. For this reason, an arm or instrumen-\ntality of the State generally enjoys the same immunity as\nthe sovereign itself. E.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe,\n519 U. S. 425, 429–430 (1997).           Similarly, lawsuits\nbrought against employees in their official capacity “repre-\nsent only another way of pleading an action against an\nentity of which an officer is an agent,” and they may also\nbe barred by sovereign immunity. Kentucky v. Graham,\n473 U. S. 159, 165–166 (1985) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The distinction between individual- and official-capacity\nsuits is paramount here. In an official-capacity claim, the\nrelief sought is only nominally against the official and in\nfact is against the official’s office and thus the sovereign\nitself. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58,\n71 (1989); Dugan v. Rank, 372 U. S. 609, 611, 620–622\n(1963). This is why, when officials sued in their official\ncapacities leave office, their successors automatically\nassume their role in the litigation. Hafer, 502 U. S., at 25.\nThe real party in interest is the government entity, not the\nnamed official. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,\n663–665 (1974). “Personal-capacity suits, on the other\nhand, seek to impose individual liability upon a govern-\nment officer for actions taken under color of state law.”\nHafer, 502 U. S., at 25 (emphasis added); see also id., at\n27–31 (discharged employees entitled to bring personal\ndamages action against state auditor general); cf. Bivens\nv. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388\n(1971). “[O]fficers sued in their personal capacity come to\ncourt as individuals,” Hafer, 502 U. S., at 27, and the real\nparty in interest is the individual, not the sovereign.\n   The identity of the real party in interest dictates what\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimmunities may be available. Defendants in an official-\ncapacity action may assert sovereign immunity. Graham,\n473 U. S., at 167. An officer in an individual-capacity\naction, on the other hand, may be able to assert personal\nimmunity defenses, such as, for example, absolute prose-\ncutorial immunity in certain circumstances. Van de Kamp\nv. Goldstein, 555 U. S. 335, 342–344 (2009). But sovereign\nimmunity “does not erect a barrier against suits to impose\nindividual and personal liability.” Hafer, 502 U. S., at 30–\n31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Alden v. Maine,\n527 U. S. 706, 757 (1996).\n                             B\n  There is no reason to depart from these general rules in\nthe context of tribal sovereign immunity. It is apparent\nthat these general principles foreclose Clarke’s sovereign\nimmunity defense in this case. This is a negligence action\narising from a tort committed by Clarke on an interstate\nhighway within the State of Connecticut. The suit is\nbrought against a tribal employee operating a vehicle\nwithin the scope of his employment but on state lands, and\nthe judgment will not operate against the Tribe. This is\nnot a suit against Clarke in his official capacity. It is\nsimply a suit against Clarke to recover for his personal\nactions, which “will not require action by the sovereign or\ndisturb the sovereign’s property.” Larson v. Domestic and\nForeign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 687 (1949). We\nare cognizant of the Supreme Court of Connecticut’s con-\ncern that plaintiffs not circumvent tribal sovereign im-\nmunity. But here, that immunity is simply not in play.\nClarke, not the Gaming Authority, is the real party in\ninterest.\n  In ruling that Clarke was immune from this suit solely\nbecause he was acting within the scope of his employment,\nthe court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employ-\nees beyond what common-law sovereign immunity princi-\n\u000c8                         LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nples would recognize for either state or federal employees.\nSee, e.g., Graham, 473 U. S., at 167–168. The protection\noffered by tribal sovereign immunity here is no broader\nthan the protection offered by state or federal sovereign\nimmunity.\n  Accordingly, under established sovereign immunity\nprinciples, the Gaming Authority’s immunity does not, in\nthese circumstances, bar suit against Clarke.2\n                            III\n  The conclusion above notwithstanding, Clarke argues\nthat the Gaming Authority is the real party in interest\nhere because it is required by Mohegan Tribe Code §4–52\nto indemnify Clarke for any adverse judgment.3\n                            A\n  We have never before had occasion to decide whether an\nindemnification clause is sufficient to extend a sovereign\nimmunity defense to a suit against an employee in his\nindividual capacity. We hold that an indemnification\n——————\n  2 There are, of course, personal immunity defenses distinct from sov-\n\nereign immunity. E.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 811–815\n(1982). Clarke argues for the first time before this Court that one\nparticular form of personal immunity is available to him here—official\nimmunity. See Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U. S. 292, 295–297 (1988). That\ndefense is not properly before us now, however, given that Clarke’s\nmotion to dismiss was based solely on tribal sovereign immunity. See\nTravelers Casualty \u0026 Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas \u0026 Elec. Co., 549\nU. S. 443, 455 (2007).\n  3 As noted above, the Supreme Court of Connecticut did not reach\n\nwhether Clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity on the basis\nof the indemnification statute. We nevertheless consider the issue\nfairly included within the question presented, as it is a purely legal\nquestion that is an integral part of Clarke’s sovereign immunity argu-\nment and that was both raised to and passed on by the trial court. See\nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985) (“[T]he purely legal\nquestion on which [petitioner’s] claim of immunity turns is appropriate\nfor our immediate resolution notwithstanding that it was not addressed\nby the Court of Appeals” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u000c                    Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision cannot, as a matter of law, extend sovereign\nimmunity to individual employees who would otherwise\nnot fall under its protective cloak.\n   Our holding follows naturally from the principles dis-\ncussed above. Indeed, we have applied these same princi-\nples to a different question before—whether a state in-\nstrumentality may invoke the State’s immunity from suit\neven when the Federal Government has agreed to indem-\nnify that instrumentality against adverse judgments. In\nRegents of Univ. of Cal., an individual brought suit against\nthe University of California, a public university of the State\nof California, for breach of contract related to his employ-\nment at a laboratory operated by the university pursuant\nto a contract with the Federal Government. We held that\nthe indemnification provision did not divest the state\ninstrumentality of Eleventh Amendment immunity. 519\nU. S., at 426. Our analysis turned on where the potential\nlegal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the\ndamages award ultimately came. Because the lawsuit\nbound the university, we held, the Eleventh Amendment\napplied to the litigation even though the damages award\nwould ultimately be paid by the federal Department of\nEnergy. Id., at 429–431. Our reasoning remains the\nsame. The critical inquiry is who may be legally bound by\nthe court’s adverse judgment, not who will ultimately pick\nup the tab.4\n  Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no jurisdiction\nover the Tribe or the Gaming Authority, and their judg-\nments will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in\n——————\n   4 Our holding in Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation,\n\n513 U. S. 30 (1994), is not to the contrary. There the immunity ques-\ntion turned on whether the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation\nwas a state agency cloaked with Eleventh Amendment immunity such\nthat any judgment “must be paid out of a State’s treasury.” Id., at 48,\n51–52 (emphasis added). Here, unlike in Hess, the damages judgment\nwould not come from the sovereign.\n\u000c10                    LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nany way. The Tribe’s indemnification provision does not\nsomehow convert the suit against Clarke into a suit\nagainst the sovereign; when Clarke is sued in his individ-\nual capacity, he is held responsible only for his individual\nwrongdoing. Moreover, indemnification is not a certainty\nhere. Clarke will not be indemnified by the Gaming Au-\nthority should it determine that he engaged in “wanton,\nreckless, or malicious” activity. Mohegan Tribe Code §4–\n52. That determination is not necessary to the disposition\nof the Lewises’ suit against Clarke in the Connecticut\nstate courts, which is a separate legal matter.\n                               B\n   Clarke notes that courts have extended sovereign im-\nmunity to private healthcare insurance companies under\ncertain circumstances. See, e.g., Pani v. Empire Blue\nCross Blue Shield, 152 F. 3d 67, 71–72 (CA2 1998); Pine\nView Gardens, Inc. v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 485 F. 2d\n1073, 1074–1075 (CADC 1973); Brief for Respondent 19,\nn. 4. But, these cases rest on the proposition that the\nfiscal intermediaries are essentially state instrumentali-\nties, as the governing regulations make clear. See 42 CFR\n§421.5(b) (2016) (providing that the Medicare Administra-\ntor “is the real party of interest in any litigation involving\nthe administration of the program”). It is well established\nin our precedent that a suit against an arm or instrumen-\ntality of the State is treated as one against the State itself.\nSee Regents of Univ. of Cal., 519 U. S., at 429. We have\nnot before treated a lawsuit against an individual em-\nployee as one against a state instrumentality, and Clarke\noffers no persuasive reason to do so now.\n   Nor have we ever held that a civil rights suit under 42\nU. S. C. §1983 against a state officer in his individual\ncapacity implicates the Eleventh Amendment and a\n\u000c                      Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nState’s sovereign immunity from suit.5 Federal appellate\ncourts that have considered the indemnity question have\nrejected the argument that an indemnity statute brings\nthe Eleventh Amendment into play in §1983 actions. See,\ne.g., Stoner v. Wisconsin Dept. of Agriculture, Trade and\nConsumer Protection, 50 F. 3d 481, 482–483 (CA7 1995);\nBlalock v. Schwinden, 862 F. 2d 1352, 1354 (CA9 1988);\nDuckworth v. Franzen, 780 F. 2d 645, 650 (CA7 1985).\nThese cases rely on the concern that originally drove the\nadoption of the Eleventh Amendment—the protection of\nthe States against involuntary liability. See Hess v. Port\nAuthority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 39, 48\n(1994). But States institute indemnification policies vol-\nuntarily. And so, indemnification provisions do not impli-\ncate one of the underlying rationales for state sovereign\nimmunity—a government’s ability to make its own deci-\nsions about “the allocation of scarce resources.” Alden, 527\nU. S., at 751.\n   Finally, our conclusion that indemnification provisions\ndo not alter the real-party-in-interest analysis for purposes\nof sovereign immunity is consistent with the practice\nthat applies in the contexts of diversity of citizenship and\njoinder. In assessing diversity jurisdiction, courts look to\nthe real parties to the controversy. Navarro Savings Assn.\nv. Lee, 446 U. S. 458, 460 (1980). Applying this principle,\ncourts below have agreed that the fact that a third party\nindemnifies one of the named parties to the case does not,\nas a general rule, influence the diversity analysis. See,\ne.g., Corfield v. Dallas Glen Hills LP, 355 F. 3d 853, 865\n(CA5 2003); E. R. Squibb \u0026 Sons, Inc. v. Accident \u0026 Cas.\nIns. Co., 160 F. 3d 925, 936–937 (CA2 1998). They have\nsimilarly held that a party does not become a required\nparty for joinder purposes under Federal Rule of Civil\n——————\n  5 A suit against a state officer in his official, rather than individual,\n\ncapacity might implicate the Eleventh Amendment. See Kentucky v.\nGraham, 473 U. S. 159, 165–166 (1985).\n\u000c12                   LEWIS v. CLARKE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nProcedure 19 simply by virtue of indemnifying one of the\nnamed parties. See, e.g., Gardiner v. Virgin Islands Water\n\u0026 Power Auth., 145 F. 3d 635, 641 (CA3 1998); Rochester\nMethodist Hospital v. Travelers Ins. Co., 728 F. 2d 1006,\n1016–1017 (CA8 1984).\n  In sum, although tribal sovereign immunity is implicated\nwhen the suit is brought against individual officers in\ntheir official capacities, it is simply not present when the\nclaim is made against those employees in their individual\ncapacities. An indemnification statute such as the one at\nissue here does not alter the analysis. Clarke may not\navail himself of a sovereign immunity defense.\n                             IV\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U.

These dissenting opinions\nexplain why tribes, interacting with nontribal members\noutside reservation boundaries, should be subject to non-\ndiscriminatory state laws of general application. I agree\nwith the Court, however, that a voluntary indemnity\nundertaking does not convert a suit against a tribal em-\nployee, in the employee’s individual capacity, into a suit\nagainst the tribe. I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment.\n\u000c",

	"citing_sentence": "Our cases establish that, in the context of lawsuits against state and federal employees or entities, courts should look to whether the sovereign is the real party in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25 (1991).",
	"citing_paragraph": "Our cases establish that, in the context of lawsuits against state and federal employees or entities, courts should look to whether the sovereign is the real party in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25 (1991). In making this assessment, courts may not simply rely on the characterization of the parties in the complaint, but rather must determine in the first instance whether the remedy sought is truly against the sovereign. See, e.g., Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 500–502 (1921). If, for example, an action is in essence against a State even if the State is not a named party, then the State is the real party in interest and is entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amend- ment’s protection. For this reason, an arm or instrumen- tality of the State generally enjoys the same immunity as the sovereign itself. E.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429–430 (1997). Similarly, lawsuits brought against employees in their official capacity “repre- sent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent,” and they may also be barred by sovereign immunity. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 165–166 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).",
