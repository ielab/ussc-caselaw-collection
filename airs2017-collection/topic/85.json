S. ___\n(2012), that a sentencer is “require[d] . . . to take into\naccount how children are different, and how those differ-\nences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a\nlifetime in prison.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Children\nare “constitutionally different from adults for purposes of\nsentencing” in light of their lack of maturity and under-\ndeveloped sense of responsibility, their susceptibility to\nnegative influences and outside pressure, and their less\nwell-formed character traits. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nFailing to consider these constitutionally significant dif-\nferences, we explained, “poses too great a risk of dispro-\nportionate punishment.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17). In the\ncontext of life without parole, we stated that “appropriate\noccasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible\npenalty will be uncommon.” Ibid.\n   Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.

Arizona.\n\u000c2                    TATUM v. ARIZONA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthat Miller “announced a substantive rule of constitutional\nlaw.” 577 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20). That rule draws “a\nline between children whose crimes reflect transient im-\nmaturity and those rare children whose crimes reflect\nirreparable corruption” and allows for the possibility “that\nlife without parole could be a proportionate sentence [only]\nfor the latter kind of juvenile offender.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   The petitioners in these cases were sentenced to life\nwithout the possibility of parole for crimes they committed\nbefore they turned 18. A grant, vacate, and remand of\nthese cases in light of Montgomery permits the lower\ncourts to consider whether these petitioners’ sentences\ncomply with the substantive rule governing the imposition\nof a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile offender.\n   JUSTICE ALITO questions this course, noting that the\njudges in these cases considered petitioners’ youth during\nsentencing. As Montgomery made clear, however, “[e]ven\nif a court considers a child’s age before sentencing him or\nher to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the\nEighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects unfor-\ntunate yet transient immaturity.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op.,\nat 16–17) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   On the record before us, none of the sentencing judges\naddressed the question Miller and Montgomery require a\nsentencer to ask: whether the petitioner was among the\nvery “rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes\nreflect permanent incorrigibility.” 577 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17).\n   Take Najar v. Arizona, No. 15–8878. There, the sen-\ntencing judge identified as mitigating factors that the\ndefendant was “16 years of age” and “emotionally and\nphysically immature.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15–\n8878, p. A–51. He said no more on this front. He then\ndiscounted the petitioner’s efforts to rehabilitate himself\nas “nothing significant,” despite commending him for those\n\u000c                 Cite as: 580 U.

The sentencing judge did not evaluate whether\nNajar represented the “rare juvenile offender who exhibits\nsuch irretrievable depravity that rehabilitation is impos-\nsible and life without parole is justified.” Montgomery, 577\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\n  Purcell v. Arizona, No. 15–8842, is no different. The\nsentencing judge found that Purcell’s age at the time of his\noffense—16 years old—qualified as a statutory mitigating\nfactor. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15–8842, p. A–80. He\nthen minimized the relevance of Purcell’s troubled child-\nhood, concluding that “this case sums up the result of\ndefendant’s family environment: he became a double-\nmurderer at age 16. Nothing more need be said.” Id., at\nA–83. So here too, the sentencing judge did not undertake\nthe evaluation that Montgomery requires. He imposed a\nsentence of life without parole despite finding that Purcell\nwas “likely to do well in the structured environment of a\nprison and that he possesses the capacity to be meaning-\nfully rehabilitated.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15–8842,\nat A–83.\n  The other petitions are similar. In Tatum v. Arizona,\nNo. 15–8850, and DeShaw v. Arizona, No. 15–9057, the\nsentencing judge merely noted age as a mitigating circum-\nstance without further discussion. In Arias v. Arizona,\nNo. 15–9044, the record before us does not contain a sen-\ntencing transcript or order reflecting the factors the sen-\ntencing judge considered.\n  It is clear after Montgomery that the Eighth Amend-\nment requires more than mere consideration of a juvenile\noffender’s age before the imposition of a sentence of life\nwithout parole. It requires that a sentencer decide whether\nthe juvenile offender before it is a child “whose crimes\nreflect transient immaturity” or is one of “those rare chil-\ndren whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption” for\nwhom a life without parole sentence may be appropriate.\n\u000c4                   TATUM v. ARIZONA\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n577 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).

I expect that the Arizona\ncourts will be as puzzled by this directive as I am.\n   In Montgomery, the Court held that Miller v. Alabama,\n567 U. S. ___ (2012), is retroactive. 577 U. S., at ___ (slip.\nop., at 20). That holding has no bearing whatsoever on the\ndecisions that the Court now vacates. The Arizona cases\nat issue here were decided after Miller, and in each case\nthe court expressly assumed that Miller was applicable to\nthe sentence that had been imposed. Therefore, if the\nCourt is taken at its word—that is, it simply wants the\nArizona courts to take Montgomery into account—there is\nnothing for those courts to do.\n   It is possible that what the majority wants is for the\nlower courts to reconsider the application of Miller to the\ncases at issue,† but if that is the Court’s aim, it is misusing\n——————\n  * This opinion also applies to four other petitions: No. 15–8842, Pur-\ncell v.

We do not GVR so that a lower court can\nreconsider the application of a precedent that it has al-\nready considered.\n   In any event, the Arizona decisions at issue are fully\nconsistent with Miller’s central holding, namely, that\nmandatory life without parole for juvenile offenders is\nunconstitutional. 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). A sen-\ntence of life without parole was imposed in each of these\ncases, not because Arizona law dictated such a sentence,\nbut because a court, after taking the defendant’s youth\ninto account, found that life without parole was appropri-\nate in light of the nature of the offense and the offender.\n   It is true that the Miller Court also opined that “life\nwithout parole is excessive for all but ‘the rare juvenile\noffender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption,’ ”\nMontgomery, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17) (quoting Miller,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)), but the record in the cases at issue provides\nample support for the conclusion that these “children” fall\ninto that category.\n   For example, in Purcell v. Arizona, No. 15–8842, a 16-\nyear-old gang member fired a sawed-off shotgun into a\ngroup of teenagers, killing two of them, under the belief\nthat they had flashed a rival gang’s sign at him. He was\nultimately convicted of two counts of first-degree murder,\nnine counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one\ncount each of aggravated assault and misconduct involv-\ning weapons.
