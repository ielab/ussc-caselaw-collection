Decided March 6, 2017\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   A Nevada jury convicted petitioner Michael Damon\nRippo of first-degree murder and other offenses and sen-\ntenced him to death. During his trial, Rippo received\ninformation that the judge was the target of a federal\nbribery probe, and he surmised that the Clark County\nDistrict Attorney’s Office—which was prosecuting him—\nwas playing a role in that investigation. Rippo moved for\nthe judge’s disqualification under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, contending that a judge\ncould not impartially adjudicate a case in which one of the\nparties was criminally investigating him. But the trial\njudge declined to recuse himself, and (after that judge’s\nindictment on federal charges) a different judge later\ndenied Rippo’s motion for a new trial. The Nevada Su-\npreme Court affirmed on direct appeal, reasoning in part\nthat Rippo had not introduced evidence that state authori-\nties were involved in the federal investigation.
