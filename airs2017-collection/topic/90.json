Here, the State has no legitimate\nreason—penological or otherwise—to prohibit Arthur’s\ncounsel from possessing a phone during the execution,\nparticularly in light of the demonstrated risk that midazo-\nlam will fail.

To permit access to a telephone would impose\nno cost or burden on the State; Arthur’s attorneys have\noffered to pay for the phone and provide it for the State’s\ninspection. The State’s refusal serves only to frustrate any\neffort by Arthur’s attorneys to petition the courts in the\nevent of yet another botched execution.
