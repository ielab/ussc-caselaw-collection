The divorce decree of peti-\n  tioner John Howell and respondent Sandra Howell awarded Sandra\n  50% of John’s future Air Force retirement pay, which she began to re-\n  ceive when John retired the following year. About 13 years later, the\n  Department of Veterans Affairs found that John was partially disa-\n  bled due to an earlier service-related injury.

By his election, John waived about\n  $250 of his retirement pay, which also reduced the value of Sandra’s\n  50% share. Sandra petitioned the Arizona family court to enforce the\n  original divorce decree and restore the value of her share of John’s to-\n  tal retirement pay. The court held that the original divorce decree\n  had given Sandra a vested interest in the prewaiver amount of John’s\n  retirement pay and ordered John to ensure that she receive her full\n  50% without regard for the disability waiver. The Arizona Supreme\n  Court affirmed, holding that federal law did not pre-empt the family\n  court’s order.\nHeld: A state court may not order a veteran to indemnify a divorced\n spouse for the loss in the divorced spouse’s portion of the veteran’s re-\n tirement pay caused by the veteran’s waiver of retirement pay to re-\n ceive service-related disability benefits.

The Arizona Supreme Court\n    attempted to distinguish Mansell by emphasizing the fact that the\n    veteran’s waiver in that case took place before the divorce proceeding\n    while the waiver here took place several years after the divorce. This\n    temporal difference highlights only that John’s military pay at the\n    time it came to Sandra was subject to a future contingency, meaning\n    that the value of Sandra’s share of military retirement pay was pos-\n    sibly worth less at the time of the divorce. Nothing in this circum-\n    stance makes the Arizona courts’ reimbursement award to Sandra\n    any the less an award of the portion of military pay that John waived\n    in order to obtain disability benefits. That the Arizona courts re-\n    ferred to her interest in the waivable portion as having “vested” does\n    not help: State courts cannot “vest” that which they lack the authori-\n    ty to give. Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the\n    family court order as an order requiring John to “reimburse” or to\n    “indemnify” Sandra, rather than an order dividing property, a se-\n    mantic difference and nothing more. Regardless of their form, such\n    orders displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the ac-\n    complishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Con-\n    gress. Family courts remain free to take account of the contingency\n    that some military retirement pay might be waived or take account of\n    reductions in value when calculating or recalculating the need for\n    spousal support. Here, however, the state courts made clear that the\n    original divorce decree divided the whole of John’s military pay, and\n    their decisions rested entirely upon the need to restore Sandra’s lost\n    portion.

See \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e. §1408(c)(1). The\nstatute, however, exempts from this grant of permission\nany amount that the Government deducts “as a result of a\nwaiver” that the veteran must make “in order to receive”\ndisability benefits. §1408(a)(4)(B). We have held that a\nState cannot treat as community property, and divide at\ndivorce, this portion (the waived portion) of the veteran’s\nretirement pay. See Mansell v. Mansell, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112267\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/112267/mansell-v-mansell/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e490\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e581\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e,\n594–595 (1989).\n  In this case a State treated as community property and\nawarded to a veteran’s spouse upon divorce a portion of\nthe veteran’s total retirement pay. Long after the divorce,\nthe veteran waived a share of the retirement pay in order\nto receive nontaxable disability benefits from the Federal\nGovernment instead. Can the State subsequently in-\ncrease, pro rata, the amount the divorced spouse receives\neach month from the veteran’s retirement pay in order to\nindemnify the divorced spouse for the loss caused by the\nveteran’s waiver? The question is complicated, but the\n\u000c2                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanswer is not. Our cases and the statute make clear that\nthe answer to the indemnification question is “no.”\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Federal Government has long provided retirement\npay to those veterans who have retired from the Armed\nForces after serving, e.g., 20 years or more. It also pro-\nvides disabled members of the Armed Forces with disabil-\nity benefits. In order to prevent double counting, however,\nfederal law typically insists that, to receive disability\nbenefits, a retired veteran must give up an equivalent\namount of retirement pay. And, since retirement pay is\ntaxable while disability benefits are not, the veteran often\nelects to waive retirement pay in order to receive disability\nbenefits.

The question was whether a State\ncould consider any of a veteran’s retirement pay to be a\nform of community property, divisible at divorce. The\nCourt concluded that the States could not. See McCarty,\nsupra. We noted that the relevant legislative history\nreferred to military retirement pay as a “ ‘personal enti-\ntlement.’ ” Id., at 224. We added that other language in\nthe statute as well as its history made “clear that Con-\ngress intended that military retired pay ‘actually reach the\nbeneficiary.’ ” Id., at 228.

And we\nconcluded that the division of military retirement pay by\nthe States threatened to harm clear and substantial fed-\neral interests. Hence federal law pre-empted the state\nlaw. Id., at 235.\n  In 1982 Congress responded by passing the Uniformed\nServices Former Spouses’ Protection Act, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e.\n§1408. Congress wrote that a State may treat veterans’\n“disposable retired pay” as divisible property, i.e., commu-\nnity property divisible upon divorce. §1408(c)(1). But the\nnew Act expressly excluded from its definition of “dispos-\nable retired pay” amounts deducted from that pay “as a\nresult of a waiver . . . required by law in order to receive”\ndisability benefits. §1408(a)(4)(B). (A recent amendment\nto the statute renumbered the waiver provision. It now\nappears at §1408(a)(4)(A)(ii).      See Pub. L. 114–328,\n§641(a), 130 Stat. 2164.)\n  In 1989 we interpreted the new federal language in\nMansell, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112267\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/112267/mansell-v-mansell/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e490\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e581\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e. Major Gerald E. Mansell and his\nwife had divorced in California. At the time of the divorce,\nthey entered into a “property settlement which provided,\nin part, that Major Mansell would pay Mrs. Mansell 50\npercent of his total military retirement pay, including that\nportion of retirement pay waived so that Major Mansell\ncould receive disability benefits.” Id., at 586. The divorce\ndecree incorporated this settlement and permitted the\ndivision. Major Mansell later moved to modify the decree\nso that it would omit the portion of the retirement pay\nthat he had waived. The California courts refused to do\nso. But this Court reversed. It held that federal law\nforbade California from treating the waived portion as\ncommunity property divisible at divorce.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the Court, pointed\nout that federal law, as construed in McCarty, “completely\npre-empted the application of state community property\nlaw to military retirement pay.” 490 U. S., at 588. He\n\u000c4                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted that Congress could “overcome” this pre-emption “by\nenacting an affirmative grant of authority giving the\nStates the power to treat military retirement pay as com-\nmunity property.” Ibid. He recognized that Congress,\nwith its new Act, had done that, but only to a limited\nextent. The Act provided a “precise and limited” grant of\nthe power to divide federal military retirement pay. Ibid.\nIt did not “gran[t]” the States “the authority to treat\ntotal retired pay as community property.” Id., at 589.\nRather, Congress excluded from its grant of authority the\ndisability-related waived portion of military retirement\npay. Hence, in respect to the waived portion of retirement\npay, McCarty, with its rule of federal pre-emption, still\napplies. Ibid.\n                             B\n  John Howell, the petitioner, and Sandra Howell, the\nrespondent, were divorced in 1991, while John was serving\nin the Air Force. Anticipating John’s eventual retirement,\nthe divorce decree treated John’s future retirement pay as\ncommunity property. It awarded Sandra “as her sole and\nseparate property FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of [John’s]\nmilitary retirement when it begins.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n41a. It also ordered John to pay child support of $585 per\nmonth and spousal maintenance of $150 per month until\nthe time of John’s retirement.\n  In 1992 John retired from the Air Force and began to\nreceive military retirement pay, half of which went to\nSandra. About 13 years later the Department of Veterans\nAffairs found that John was 20% disabled due to a service-\nrelated shoulder injury. John elected to receive disability\nbenefits and consequently had to waive about $250 per\nmonth of the roughly $1,500 of military retirement pay he\nshared with Sandra. Doing so reduced the amount of\nretirement pay that he and Sandra received by about $125\nper month each.

In Mansell, the Court held that federal law com-\npletely pre-empts the States from treating waived military\nretirement pay as divisible community property. 490\nU. S., at 594–595. Yet that which federal law pre-empts is\njust what the Arizona family court did here. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 28a, 35a (finding that the divorce decree gave\nSandra a “vested” interest in John’s retirement pay and\nordering that Sandra receive her share “without regard for\nthe disability”).\n   The Arizona Supreme Court, the respondent, and the\nSolicitor General try to distinguish Mansell. But we do\nnot find their efforts convincing. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt, like several other state courts, emphasized the fact\nthat the veteran’s waiver in Mansell took place before the\ndivorce proceeding; the waiver here took place several\nyears after the divorce proceedings.

Hence here, as the\nSolicitor General emphasizes, the nonmilitary spouse and\nthe family court were likely to have assumed that a full\nshare of the veteran’s retirement pay would remain avail-\nable after the assets were distributed.\n   Nonetheless, the temporal difference highlights only\nthat John’s military retirement pay at the time it came to\nSandra was subject to later reduction (should John exer-\ncise a waiver to receive disability benefits to which he is\nentitled). The state court did not extinguish (and most\nlikely would not have had the legal power to extinguish)\nthat future contingency. The existence of that contingency\nmeant that the value of Sandra’s share of military retire-\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment pay was possibly worth less—perhaps less than\nSandra and others thought—at the time of the divorce. So\ntoo is an ownership interest in property (say, A’s property\ninterest in Blackacre) worth less if it is subject to defea-\nsance or termination upon the occurrence of a later event\n(say, B’s death). See generally Restatement (Third) of\nProperty §24.3 (2010) (describing property interests that\nare defeasible); id., §25.3, and Comment a (describing\ncontingent future interests subject to divestment).\n  We see nothing in this circumstance that makes the\nreimbursement award to Sandra any the less an award of\nthe portion of military retirement pay that John waived in\norder to obtain disability benefits. And that is the portion\nthat Congress omitted from the Act’s definition of “dispos-\nable retired pay,” namely, the portion that federal law\nprohibits state courts from awarding to a divorced veter-\nan’s former spouse. Mansell, supra, at 589. That the\nArizona courts referred to Sandra’s interest in the waiv-\nable portion as having “vested” does not help. State\ncourts cannot “vest” that which (under governing federal\nlaw) they lack the authority to give. Cf. \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e.\n§5301(a)(1) (providing that disability benefits are gener-\nally nonassignable). Accordingly, while the divorce decree\nmight be said to “vest” Sandra with an immediate right to\nhalf of John’s military retirement pay, that interest is, at\nmost, contingent, depending for its amount on a subse-\nquent condition: John’s possible waiver of that pay.\n  Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the\nfamily court order as an order requiring John to “reim-\nburse” or to “indemnify” Sandra, rather than an order that\ndivides property. The difference is semantic and nothing\nmore. The principal reason the state courts have given for\nordering reimbursement or indemnification is that they\nwish to restore the amount previously awarded as com-\nmunity property, i.e., to restore that portion of retirement\npay lost due to the postdivorce waiver. And we note that\n\u000c8                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhere, the amount of indemnification mirrors the waived\nretirement pay, dollar for dollar. Regardless of their form,\nsuch reimbursement and indemnification orders displace\nthe federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accom-\nplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of\nCongress. All such orders are thus pre-empted.\n   The basic reasons McCarty gave for believing that Con-\ngress intended to exempt military retirement pay from\nstate community property laws apply a fortiori to disabil-\nity pay. See 453 U. S., at 232–235 (describing the federal\ninterests in attracting and retaining military personnel).\nAnd those reasons apply with equal force to a veteran’s\npostdivorce waiver to receive disability benefits to which\nhe or she has become entitled.\n   We recognize, as we recognized in Mansell, the hardship\nthat congressional pre-emption can sometimes work on\ndivorcing spouses. See 490 U. S., at 594. But we note that\na family court, when it first determines the value of a\nfamily’s assets, remains free to take account of the contin-\ngency that some military retirement pay might be waived,\nor, as the petitioner himself recognizes, take account of\nreductions in value when it calculates or recalculates the\nneed for spousal support.

Argued March 20, 2017—Decided May 15, 2017\nThe Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act authorizes\n  States to treat veterans’ “disposable retired pay” as community prop-\n  erty divisible upon divorce, 10 U. S. C. §1408, but expressly excludes\n  from its definition of “disposable retired pay” amounts deducted from\n  that pay “as a result of a waiver . . . required by law in order to re-\n  ceive” disability benefits, §1408(a)(4)(B). The divorce decree of peti-\n  tioner John Howell and respondent Sandra Howell awarded Sandra\n  50% of John’s future Air Force retirement pay, which she began to re-\n  ceive when John retired the following year. About 13 years later, the\n  Department of Veterans Affairs found that John was partially disa-\n  bled due to an earlier service-related injury. To receive disability\n  pay, federal law required John to give up an equivalent amount of re-\n  tirement pay. 38 U. S. C. §5305. By his election, John waived about\n  $250 of his retirement pay, which also reduced the value of Sandra’s\n  50% share. Sandra petitioned the Arizona family court to enforce the\n  original divorce decree and restore the value of her share of John’s to-\n  tal retirement pay. The court held that the original divorce decree\n  had given Sandra a vested interest in the prewaiver amount of John’s\n  retirement pay and ordered John to ensure that she receive her full\n  50% without regard for the disability waiver. The Arizona Supreme\n  Court affirmed, holding that federal law did not pre-empt the family\n  court’s order.\nHeld: A state court may not order a veteran to indemnify a divorced\n spouse for the loss in the divorced spouse’s portion of the veteran’s re-\n tirement pay caused by the veteran’s waiver of retirement pay to re-\n ceive service-related disability benefits. This Court’s decision in\n Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581, determines the outcome here.\n There, the Court held that federal law completely pre-empts the\n States from treating waived military retirement pay as divisible\n\u000c2                         HOWELL v.

The Arizona Supreme Court\n    attempted to distinguish Mansell by emphasizing the fact that the\n    veteran’s waiver in that case took place before the divorce proceeding\n    while the waiver here took place several years after the divorce. This\n    temporal difference highlights only that John’s military pay at the\n    time it came to Sandra was subject to a future contingency, meaning\n    that the value of Sandra’s share of military retirement pay was pos-\n    sibly worth less at the time of the divorce. Nothing in this circum-\n    stance makes the Arizona courts’ reimbursement award to Sandra\n    any the less an award of the portion of military pay that John waived\n    in order to obtain disability benefits. That the Arizona courts re-\n    ferred to her interest in the waivable portion as having “vested” does\n    not help: State courts cannot “vest” that which they lack the authori-\n    ty to give. Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the\n    family court order as an order requiring John to “reimburse” or to\n    “indemnify” Sandra, rather than an order dividing property, a se-\n    mantic difference and nothing more. Regardless of their form, such\n    orders displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the ac-\n    complishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Con-\n    gress. Family courts remain free to take account of the contingency\n    that some military retirement pay might be waived or take account of\n    reductions in value when calculating or recalculating the need for\n    spousal support.

The\nstatute, however, exempts from this grant of permission\nany amount that the Government deducts “as a result of a\nwaiver” that the veteran must make “in order to receive”\ndisability benefits. §1408(a)(4)(B). We have held that a\nState cannot treat as community property, and divide at\ndivorce, this portion (the waived portion) of the veteran’s\nretirement pay. See Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581,\n594–595 (1989).\n  In this case a State treated as community property and\nawarded to a veteran’s spouse upon divorce a portion of\nthe veteran’s total retirement pay. Long after the divorce,\nthe veteran waived a share of the retirement pay in order\nto receive nontaxable disability benefits from the Federal\nGovernment instead. Can the State subsequently in-\ncrease, pro rata, the amount the divorced spouse receives\neach month from the veteran’s retirement pay in order to\nindemnify the divorced spouse for the loss caused by the\nveteran’s waiver? The question is complicated, but the\n\u000c2                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanswer is not. Our cases and the statute make clear that\nthe answer to the indemnification question is “no.”\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Federal Government has long provided retirement\npay to those veterans who have retired from the Armed\nForces after serving, e.g., 20 years or more. It also pro-\nvides disabled members of the Armed Forces with disabil-\nity benefits. In order to prevent double counting, however,\nfederal law typically insists that, to receive disability\nbenefits, a retired veteran must give up an equivalent\namount of retirement pay. And, since retirement pay is\ntaxable while disability benefits are not, the veteran often\nelects to waive retirement pay in order to receive disability\nbenefits. See 10 U. S. C. §3911 et seq. (Army retirement\nbenefits); §6321 et seq. (Navy and Marines retirement\nbenefits); §8911 et seq. (Air Force retirement benefits); 38\nU. S. C. §5305 (requiring a waiver to receive disability\nbenefits); §5301(a)(1) (exempting disability benefits from\ntaxation). See generally McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S.\n210, 211–215 (1981) (describing the military’s nondisabil-\nity retirement system).\n   In 1981 we considered federal military retirement pay\nalone, i.e., not in the context of pay waived to receive\ndisability benefits. The question was whether a State\ncould consider any of a veteran’s retirement pay to be a\nform of community property, divisible at divorce. The\nCourt concluded that the States could not. See McCarty,\nsupra. We noted that the relevant legislative history\nreferred to military retirement pay as a “ ‘personal enti-\ntlement.’ ” Id., at 224. We added that other language in\nthe statute as well as its history made “clear that Con-\ngress intended that military retired pay ‘actually reach the\nbeneficiary.’ ” Id., at 228. We found a “conflict between\nthe terms of the federal retirement statutes and the [state-\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconferred] community property right.” Id., at 232. And we\nconcluded that the division of military retirement pay by\nthe States threatened to harm clear and substantial fed-\neral interests. Hence federal law pre-empted the state\nlaw. Id., at 235.\n  In 1982 Congress responded by passing the Uniformed\nServices Former Spouses’ Protection Act, 10 U. S. C.\n§1408. Congress wrote that a State may treat veterans’\n“disposable retired pay” as divisible property, i.e., commu-\nnity property divisible upon divorce. §1408(c)(1). But the\nnew Act expressly excluded from its definition of “dispos-\nable retired pay” amounts deducted from that pay “as a\nresult of a waiver . . . required by law in order to receive”\ndisability benefits. §1408(a)(4)(B). (A recent amendment\nto the statute renumbered the waiver provision. It now\nappears at §1408(a)(4)(A)(ii).      See Pub. L. 114–328,\n§641(a), 130 Stat. 2164.)\n  In 1989 we interpreted the new federal language in\nMansell, 490 U. S. 581. Major Gerald E. Mansell and his\nwife had divorced in California. At the time of the divorce,\nthey entered into a “property settlement which provided,\nin part, that Major Mansell would pay Mrs. Mansell 50\npercent of his total military retirement pay, including that\nportion of retirement pay waived so that Major Mansell\ncould receive disability benefits.” Id., at 586. The divorce\ndecree incorporated this settlement and permitted the\ndivision. Major Mansell later moved to modify the decree\nso that it would omit the portion of the retirement pay\nthat he had waived. The California courts refused to do\nso. But this Court reversed. It held that federal law\nforbade California from treating the waived portion as\ncommunity property divisible at divorce.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the Court, pointed\nout that federal law, as construed in McCarty, “completely\npre-empted the application of state community property\nlaw to military retirement pay.” 490 U. S., at 588. He\n\u000c4                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted that Congress could “overcome” this pre-emption “by\nenacting an affirmative grant of authority giving the\nStates the power to treat military retirement pay as com-\nmunity property.” Ibid. He recognized that Congress,\nwith its new Act, had done that, but only to a limited\nextent. The Act provided a “precise and limited” grant of\nthe power to divide federal military retirement pay. Ibid.\nIt did not “gran[t]” the States “the authority to treat\ntotal retired pay as community property.” Id., at 589.\nRather, Congress excluded from its grant of authority the\ndisability-related waived portion of military retirement\npay. Hence, in respect to the waived portion of retirement\npay, McCarty, with its rule of federal pre-emption, still\napplies. Ibid.\n                             B\n  John Howell, the petitioner, and Sandra Howell, the\nrespondent, were divorced in 1991, while John was serving\nin the Air Force. Anticipating John’s eventual retirement,\nthe divorce decree treated John’s future retirement pay as\ncommunity property. It awarded Sandra “as her sole and\nseparate property FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of [John’s]\nmilitary retirement when it begins.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n41a. It also ordered John to pay child support of $585 per\nmonth and spousal maintenance of $150 per month until\nthe time of John’s retirement.\n  In 1992 John retired from the Air Force and began to\nreceive military retirement pay, half of which went to\nSandra. About 13 years later the Department of Veterans\nAffairs found that John was 20% disabled due to a service-\nrelated shoulder injury. John elected to receive disability\nbenefits and consequently had to waive about $250 per\nmonth of the roughly $1,500 of military retirement pay he\nshared with Sandra. Doing so reduced the amount of\nretirement pay that he and Sandra received by about $125\nper month each. In re Marriage of Howell, 238 Ariz. 407,\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n408, 361 P. 3d 936, 937 (2015)\n  Sandra then asked the Arizona family court to enforce\nthe original decree, in effect restoring the value of her\nshare of John’s total retirement pay. The court held that\nthe original divorce decree had given Sandra a “vested”\ninterest in the prewaiver amount of that pay, and ordered\nJohn to ensure that Sandra “receive her full 50% of the\nmilitary retirement without regard for the disability.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.\n  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the family court’s\ndecision. See 238 Ariz. 407, 361 P. 3d 936. It asked\nwhether the family court could “order John to indemnify\nSandra for the reduction” of her share of John’s military\nretirement pay. Id., at 409, 361 P. 3d, at 938. It wrote\nthat the family court order did not “divide” John’s waived\nmilitary retirement pay, the order did not require John “to\nrescind” his waiver, nor did the order “direct him to pay\nany amount to Sandra from his disability pay.” Id., at\n410, 361 P. 3d, at 939. Rather the family court simply\nordered John to “reimburse” Sandra for “reducing . . . her\nshare” of military retirement pay. Ibid. The high court\nconcluded that because John had made his waiver after,\nrather than before, the family court divided his military\nretirement pay, our decision in Mansell did not control the\ncase, and thus federal law did not preempt the family\ncourt’s reimbursement order. 238 Ariz., at 410, 361 P. 3d,\nat 939.\n  Because different state courts have come to different\nconclusions on the matter, we granted John Howell’s\npetition for certiorari. Compare Glover v. Ranney, 314 P.\n3d 535, 539–540 (Alaska 2013); Krapf v. Krapf, 439 Mass.\n97, 106–107, 786 N. E. 2d 318, 325–326 (2003); and John-\nson v. Johnson, 37 S. W. 3d 892, 897–898 (Tenn. 2001),\nwith Mallard v. Burkhart, 95 So. 3d 1264, 1269–1272\n(Miss. 2012); and Youngbluth v. Youngbluth, 2010 VT 40,\n188 Vt. 53, 62–65, 6 A. 3d 677, 682–685.\n\u000c6                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II\n   This Court’s decision in Mansell determines the outcome\nhere. In Mansell, the Court held that federal law com-\npletely pre-empts the States from treating waived military\nretirement pay as divisible community property. 490\nU. S., at 594–595. Yet that which federal law pre-empts is\njust what the Arizona family court did here. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 28a, 35a (finding that the divorce decree gave\nSandra a “vested” interest in John’s retirement pay and\nordering that Sandra receive her share “without regard for\nthe disability”).\n   The Arizona Supreme Court, the respondent, and the\nSolicitor General try to distinguish Mansell. But we do\nnot find their efforts convincing. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt, like several other state courts, emphasized the fact\nthat the veteran’s waiver in Mansell took place before the\ndivorce proceeding; the waiver here took place several\nyears after the divorce proceedings. See 238 Ariz., at 410,\n361 P. 3d, at 939; see also Abernethy v. Fishkin, 699 So. 2d\n235, 240 (Fla. 1997) (noting that a veteran had not yet\nwaived retirement pay at the time of the divorce and\npermitting indemnification in light of the parties’ “intent\nto maintain level monthly payments pursuant to their\nproperty settlement agreement”). Hence here, as the\nSolicitor General emphasizes, the nonmilitary spouse and\nthe family court were likely to have assumed that a full\nshare of the veteran’s retirement pay would remain avail-\nable after the assets were distributed.\n   Nonetheless, the temporal difference highlights only\nthat John’s military retirement pay at the time it came to\nSandra was subject to later reduction (should John exer-\ncise a waiver to receive disability benefits to which he is\nentitled). The state court did not extinguish (and most\nlikely would not have had the legal power to extinguish)\nthat future contingency. The existence of that contingency\nmeant that the value of Sandra’s share of military retire-\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment pay was possibly worth less—perhaps less than\nSandra and others thought—at the time of the divorce. So\ntoo is an ownership interest in property (say, A’s property\ninterest in Blackacre) worth less if it is subject to defea-\nsance or termination upon the occurrence of a later event\n(say, B’s death). See generally Restatement (Third) of\nProperty §24.3 (2010) (describing property interests that\nare defeasible); id., §25.3, and Comment a (describing\ncontingent future interests subject to divestment).\n  We see nothing in this circumstance that makes the\nreimbursement award to Sandra any the less an award of\nthe portion of military retirement pay that John waived in\norder to obtain disability benefits. And that is the portion\nthat Congress omitted from the Act’s definition of “dispos-\nable retired pay,” namely, the portion that federal law\nprohibits state courts from awarding to a divorced veter-\nan’s former spouse. Mansell, supra, at 589. That the\nArizona courts referred to Sandra’s interest in the waiv-\nable portion as having “vested” does not help. State\ncourts cannot “vest” that which (under governing federal\nlaw) they lack the authority to give. Cf. 38 U. S. C.\n§5301(a)(1) (providing that disability benefits are gener-\nally nonassignable). Accordingly, while the divorce decree\nmight be said to “vest” Sandra with an immediate right to\nhalf of John’s military retirement pay, that interest is, at\nmost, contingent, depending for its amount on a subse-\nquent condition: John’s possible waiver of that pay.\n  Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the\nfamily court order as an order requiring John to “reim-\nburse” or to “indemnify” Sandra, rather than an order that\ndivides property. The difference is semantic and nothing\nmore. The principal reason the state courts have given for\nordering reimbursement or indemnification is that they\nwish to restore the amount previously awarded as com-\nmunity property, i.e., to restore that portion of retirement\npay lost due to the postdivorce waiver. And we note that\n\u000c8                   HOWELL v. HOWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhere, the amount of indemnification mirrors the waived\nretirement pay, dollar for dollar. Regardless of their form,\nsuch reimbursement and indemnification orders displace\nthe federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accom-\nplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of\nCongress. All such orders are thus pre-empted.\n   The basic reasons McCarty gave for believing that Con-\ngress intended to exempt military retirement pay from\nstate community property laws apply a fortiori to disabil-\nity pay. See 453 U. S., at 232–235 (describing the federal\ninterests in attracting and retaining military personnel).\nAnd those reasons apply with equal force to a veteran’s\npostdivorce waiver to receive disability benefits to which\nhe or she has become entitled.\n   We recognize, as we recognized in Mansell, the hardship\nthat congressional pre-emption can sometimes work on\ndivorcing spouses. See 490 U. S., at 594. But we note that\na family court, when it first determines the value of a\nfamily’s assets, remains free to take account of the contin-\ngency that some military retirement pay might be waived,\nor, as the petitioner himself recognizes, take account of\nreductions in value when it calculates or recalculates the\nneed for spousal support. See Rose v. Rose, 481 U. S. 619,\n630–634, and n. 6 (1987); 10 U. S. C. §1408(e)(6).\n   We need not and do not decide these matters, for here\nthe state courts made clear that the original divorce de-\ncree divided the whole of John’s military retirement pay,\nand their decisions rested entirely upon the need to re-\nstore Sandra’s lost portion. Consequently, the determina-\ntion of the Supreme Court of Arizona must be reversed.\nSee Mansell, supra, at 594.\n                             III\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\u000c               Cite as: 581 U.
