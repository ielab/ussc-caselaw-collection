TEXAS\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS OF TEXAS, NINTH DISTRICT\n\n              No. 16–122.   Decided March 6, 2017\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE THOMAS respecting the denial of\ncertiorari.\n  This petition asks an important question: whether\nmodern civil-forfeiture statutes can be squared with the\nDue Process Clause and our Nation’s history.\n                               I\n   Early in the morning on April 1, 2013, a police officer\nstopped James Leonard for a traffic infraction along a\nknown drug corridor. During a search of the vehicle, the\nofficer found a safe in the trunk. Leonard and his passen-\nger, Nicosa Kane, gave conflicting stories about the con-\ntents of the safe, with Leonard at one point indicating that\nit belonged to his mother, who is the petitioner here. The\nofficer obtained a search warrant and discovered that the\nsafe contained $201,100 and a bill of sale for a Pennsylva-\nnia home.\n   The State initiated civil forfeiture proceedings against\nthe $201,100 on the ground that it was substantially\nconnected to criminal activity, namely, narcotics sales.\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 59.01 (Vernon Cum.\nSupp. 2016). The trial court issued a forfeiture order, and\npetitioner appealed. Citing the suspicious circumstances\nof the stop and the contradictory stories provided by Leon-\nard and Kane, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial\ncourt’s conclusion that the government had shown by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the money was either\nthe proceeds of a drug sale or intended to be used in such a\n\u000c2                     LEONARD v. TEXAS\n\n                    Statement of THOMAS, J.\n\nsale. It also affirmed the trial court’s rejection of petition-\ner’s innocent-owner defense. Petitioner had asserted that\nthe money was not related to a drug sale at all, but was\ninstead from a home she had recently sold in Pennsylva-\nnia. The court deemed this testimony insufficient to es-\ntablish that she was in fact an innocent owner.\n  Petitioner now challenges the constitutionality of the\nprocedures used to adjudicate the seizure of her property.\nIn particular, she argues that the Due Process Clause\nrequired the State to carry its burden by clear and con-\nvincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\n                              II\n  Modern civil forfeiture statutes are plainly designed, at\nleast in part, to punish the owner of property used for\ncriminal purposes. See, e.g., Austin v. United States, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112904\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/112904/austin-v-united-states/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e509\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e602\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 618–619 (1993). When a state wishes to punish\none of its citizens, it ordinarily proceeds against the de-\nfendant personally (known as “in personam”), and in many\ncases it must provide the defendant with full criminal\nprocedural protections. Nevertheless, for reasons dis-\ncussed below, this Court permits prosecutors seeking\nforfeiture to proceed against the property (known as\n“in rem”) and to do so civilly.

In rem proceedings often enable the government to\nseize the property without any predeprivation judicial\nprocess and to obtain forfeiture of the property even when\nthe owner is personally innocent (though some statutes,\nincluding the one here, provide for an innocent-owner\ndefense).

In another, they seized a black plant\nworker’s car and all his property (including cash he\nplanned to use for dental work), jailed him for a night,\nforced him to sign away his property, and then released\nhim on the side of the road without a phone or money.

See Bennis, supra, at 454 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (“One unaware of the history of forfeiture laws\nand 200 years of this Court’s precedent regarding such\nlaws might well assume that such a scheme is lawless—a\nviolation of due process”). I am skeptical that this histori-\ncal practice is capable of sustaining, as a constitutional\nmatter, the contours of modern practice, for two reasons.\n   First, historical forfeiture laws were narrower in most\nrespects than modern ones. Cf. James Daniel Good, 510\nU. S., at 85 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (noting that “ambitious modern statutes and\nprosecutorial practices have all but detached themselves\nfrom the ancient notion of civil forfeiture”). Most obviously,\nthey were limited to a few specific subject matters, such\nas customs and piracy. Proceeding in rem in those cases\nwas often justified by necessity, because the party respon-\nsible for the crime was frequently located overseas and\nthus beyond the personal jurisdiction of United States\ncourts. See Herpel, Toward a Constitutional Kleptocracy:\nCivil Forfeiture in America, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e96\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eMich.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003eL\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e. Rev. 1910, 1918–\n1920 (1998); see also id., at 1925–1926 (arguing that\nfounding-era precedents do not support the use of forfei-\nture against purely domestic offenses where the owner is\nplainly within the personal jurisdiction of both state and\nfederal courts). These laws were also narrower with re-\nspect to the type of property they encompassed. For ex-\nample, they typically covered only the instrumentalities of\nthe crime (such as the vessel used to transport the goods),\nnot the derivative proceeds of the crime (such as property\npurchased with money from the sale of the illegal goods).\nSee Rumson, supra, at 121–122, 125 (plurality opinion)\n(Forfeiture of criminal proceeds is a modern innovation).\n   Second, it is unclear whether courts historically permit-\n\u000c6                    LEONARD v. TEXAS\n\n                    Statement of THOMAS, J.\n\nted forfeiture actions to proceed civilly in all respects.\nSome of this Court’s early cases suggested that forfeiture\nactions were in the nature of criminal proceedings. See,\ne.g., Boyd v. United States, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91573\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/91573/boyd-v-united-states/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e116\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e616\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 633–634 (1886)\n(“We are . . . clearly of [the] opinion that proceedings\ninstituted for the purpose of declaring the forfeiture of a\nman’s property by reason of offenses committed by him,\nthough they may be civil in form, are in their nature crim-\ninal”); but see R. Waples, Treatise on Proceedings In Rem\n29–30 (1882) (collecting contrary authorities). Whether\nforfeiture is characterized as civil or criminal carries\nimportant implications for a variety of procedural protec-\ntions, including the right to a jury trial and the proper\nstandard of proof. Indeed, as relevant in this case, there is\nsome evidence that the government was historically re-\nquired to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Brig Burdett, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85950\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/85950/united-states-v-brig-burdett/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003ePet.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e682\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 690 (1835) (“The\nobject of the prosecution against the Burdett is to enforce\na forfeiture of the vessel, and all that pertains to it, for a\nviolation of a revenue law.

As a result, the\nTexas Court of Appeals lacked the opportunity to address\nthem in the first instance. I therefore concur in the denial\nof certiorari.

See Bennis, supra, at 454 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (“One unaware of the history of forfeiture laws\nand 200 years of this Court’s precedent regarding such\nlaws might well assume that such a scheme is lawless—a\nviolation of due process”). I am skeptical that this histori-\ncal practice is capable of sustaining, as a constitutional\nmatter, the contours of modern practice, for two reasons.\n   First, historical forfeiture laws were narrower in most\nrespects than modern ones. Cf. James Daniel Good, 510\nU. S., at 85 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (noting that “ambitious modern statutes and\nprosecutorial practices have all but detached themselves\nfrom the ancient notion of civil forfeiture”). Most obviously,\nthey were limited to a few specific subject matters, such\nas customs and piracy. Proceeding in rem in those cases\nwas often justified by necessity, because the party respon-\nsible for the crime was frequently located overseas and\nthus beyond the personal jurisdiction of United States\ncourts. See Herpel, Toward a Constitutional Kleptocracy:\nCivil Forfeiture in America, 96 Mich. L. Rev. 1910, 1918–\n1920 (1998); see also id., at 1925–1926 (arguing that\nfounding-era precedents do not support the use of forfei-\nture against purely domestic offenses where the owner is\nplainly within the personal jurisdiction of both state and\nfederal courts). These laws were also narrower with re-\nspect to the type of property they encompassed. For ex-\nample, they typically covered only the instrumentalities of\nthe crime (such as the vessel used to transport the goods),\nnot the derivative proceeds of the crime (such as property\npurchased with money from the sale of the illegal goods).\nSee Rumson, supra, at 121–122, 125 (plurality opinion)\n(Forfeiture of criminal proceeds is a modern innovation).\n   Second, it is unclear whether courts historically permit-\n\u000c6                    LEONARD v. TEXAS\n\n                    Statement of THOMAS, J.\n\nted forfeiture actions to proceed civilly in all respects.\nSome of this Court’s early cases suggested that forfeiture\nactions were in the nature of criminal proceedings. See,\ne.g., Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 633–634 (1886)\n(“We are . . . clearly of [the] opinion that proceedings\ninstituted for the purpose of declaring the forfeiture of a\nman’s property by reason of offenses committed by him,\nthough they may be civil in form, are in their nature crim-\ninal”); but see R. Waples, Treatise on Proceedings In Rem\n29–30 (1882) (collecting contrary authorities). Whether\nforfeiture is characterized as civil or criminal carries\nimportant implications for a variety of procedural protec-\ntions, including the right to a jury trial and the proper\nstandard of proof. Indeed, as relevant in this case, there is\nsome evidence that the government was historically re-\nquired to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Brig Burdett, 9 Pet. 682, 690 (1835) (“The\nobject of the prosecution against the Burdett is to enforce\na forfeiture of the vessel, and all that pertains to it, for a\nviolation of a revenue law. This prosecution then is a\nhighly penal one, and the penalty should not be inflicted,\nunless the infractions of the law shall be established be-\nyond reasonable doubt”).\n                             IV\n  Unfortunately, petitioner raises her due process argu-\nments for the first time in this Court. As a result, the\nTexas Court of Appeals lacked the opportunity to address\nthem in the first instance. I therefore concur in the denial\nof certiorari. Whether this Court’s treatment of the broad\nmodern forfeiture practice can be justified by the narrow\nhistorical one is certainly worthy of consideration in\ngreater detail.\n\u000c",

	"citing_paragraph": "Modern civil forfeiture statutes are plainly designed, at least in part, to punish the owner of property used for criminal purposes. See, e.g., Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 618–619 (1993). When a state wishes to punish one of its citizens, it ordinarily proceeds against the de- fendant personally (known as “in personam”), and in many cases it must provide the defendant with full criminal procedural protections. Nevertheless, for reasons dis- cussed below, this Court permits prosecutors seeking forfeiture to proceed against the property (known as “in rem”) and to do so civilly. See, e.g., United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 56–57 (1993). In rem proceedings often enable the government to seize the property without any predeprivation judicial process and to obtain forfeiture of the property even when the owner is personally innocent (though some statutes, including the one here, provide for an innocent-owner defense). Civil proceedings often lack certain procedural protections that accompany criminal proceedings, such as the right to a jury trial and a heightened standard of proof.",
