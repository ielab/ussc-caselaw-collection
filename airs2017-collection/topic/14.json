Primarily because of constitu-\ntional defects in his sentencing, his execution has been\nlong delayed. He has spent the last 40 years in prison\nunder threat of execution. And for most of that time\nSmith has been held in solitary confinement.

Long ago we observed that solitary con-\nfinement was “considered as an additional punishment of\nsuch a severe kind that it is spoken of . . . as ‘a further\nterror and peculiar mark of infamy.’ ” In re Medley, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92716\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/92716/medley/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e134\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e160\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 170 (1890).
