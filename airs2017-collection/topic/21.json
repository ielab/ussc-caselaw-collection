Argued March 1, 2017—Decided April 18, 2017\nThe Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) authoriz-\n  es the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with pri-\n  vate carriers for federal employees’ health insurance. \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e.\n  §8902(a), (d). FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision,\n  §8902(m)(1), which states that the “terms of any contract under this\n  chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or\n  benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede\n  and preempt any State or local law . . . which relates to health insur-\n  ance or plans.”\n     OPM’s contracts have long required private carriers to seek subro-\n  gation and reimbursement. Accordingly, OPM’s regulations make a\n  carrier’s “right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement\n  recoveries . . . a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits\n  or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan’s\n  coverage.” 5 CFR §890.106(b)(1). In 2015, OPM published a new rule\n  confirming that a carrier’s subrogation and reimbursement rights\n  and responsibilities “relate to the nature, provision, and extent of\n  coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits)\n  within the meaning of ” §8902(m)(1), and “are . . . effective notwith-\n  standing any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder,\n  which relates to health insurance or plans.” §890.106(h).\n     Respondent Jodie Nevils was insured under a FEHBA plan offered\n  by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri. When Nevils was in-\n  jured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.\n  Coventry subsequently asserted a lien against part of the settlement\n  Nevils recovered from the driver who caused his injuries. Nevils sat-\n  isfied the lien, then filed a class action in Missouri state court, alleg-\n  ing that, under Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or\n\u000c2       COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n reimbursement in this context, Coventry had unlawfully obtained re-\n imbursement. Coventry countered that §8902(m)(1) preempted the\n state law. The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry’s\n favor, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed. The Missouri Su-\n preme Court reversed. Finding §8902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse\n plausible readings, the court invoked a “presumption against\n preemption” to conclude that the federal statute’s preemptive scope\n excluded subrogation and reimbursement. On remand from this\n Court for further consideration in light of OPM’s 2015 rule, the Mis-\n souri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision. A majority of\n the Missouri Supreme Court also held that §8902(m)(1) violates the\n Supremacy Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. Because contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescrip-\n tions plainly “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits,”\n §8902(m)(1), they override state laws barring subrogation and reim-\n bursement. Pp. 6–9.\n       (a) This reading best comports with §8902(m)(1)’s text, context,\n and purpose. Contractual provisions for subrogation and reimburse-\n ment “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits” because subro-\n gation and reimbursement rights yield just such payments. When a\n carrier exercises its right to either reimbursement or subrogation, it\n receives from either the beneficiary or a third party “payment” re-\n specting the benefits the carrier had previously paid. The carrier’s\n very provision of benefits triggers the right to payment. Congress’\n use of the expansive phrase “relate to,” which “express[es] a broad\n pre-emptive purpose,” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"volume\"\u003e504\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003cspan class=\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"page\"\u003e374\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class=\"inline\"\u003e, 383, weighs against Nevils’ effort to narrow the term\n “payments” to exclude payments that occur “long after” a carrier’s\n provision of benefits. Nevils’ argument that Congress intended to\n preempt only state coverage requirements, e.g., inclusion of acupunc-\n ture and chiropractic services, also miscarries.\n    The statutory context and purpose reinforce this conclusion.\n FEHBA concerns “benefits from a federal health insurance plan for\n federal employees that arise from a federal law.” Bell v.

The statute itself, not a contract, strips state law of its force.\n  FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only if they fall within\n  §8902(m)(1)’s preemptive scope. Many other federal statutes found to\n  preempt state law, including the Employee Retirement Income Secu-\n  rity Act of 1974 and the Federal Arbitration Act, leave the context-\n  specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.                 While\n  §8902(m)(1)’s phrasing may differ from those other statutes’,\n  FEHBA’s express-preemption provision manifests the same intent to\n  preempt state law.

FEHBA contains a provision expressly\npreempting state law. §8902(m)(1). That provision reads:\n    “The terms of any contract under this chapter which\n    relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or\n    benefits (including payments with respect to benefits)\n    shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or\n    any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to\n    health insurance or plans.”\nContracts OPM negotiates with private carriers provide\nfor reimbursement and subrogation.         Reimbursement\nrequires an insured employee who receives payment from\nanother source (e.g., the proceeds yielded by a tort claim)\nto return healthcare costs earlier paid out by the carrier.\nSubrogation involves transfer of the right to a third-party\npayment from the insured employee to the carrier, who\n\u000c2     COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncan then pursue the claim against the third party. Several\nStates, however, Missouri among them, bar enforcement of\ncontractual subrogation and reimbursement provisions.\n   The questions here presented: Does FEHBA’s express-\npreemption prescription, §8902(m)(1), override state law\nprohibiting subrogation and reimbursement; and if\n§8902(m)(1) has that effect, is the statutory prescription\nconsistent with the Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art.\nVI, cl. 2? We hold, contrary to the decision of the Missouri\nSupreme Court, that contractual subrogation and reim-\nbursement prescriptions plainly “relate to . . . payments\nwith respect to benefits,” §8902(m)(1); therefore, by statu-\ntory instruction, they override state law barring subroga-\ntion and reimbursement. We further hold, again contrary\nto the Missouri Supreme Court, that the regime Congress\nenacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause. Section\n8902(m)(1) itself, not the contracts OPM negotiates, trig-\ngers the federal preemption. As Congress directed, where\nFEHBA contract terms “relate to the nature, provision, or\nextent of coverage or benefits (including payments with\nrespect to benefits),” §8902(m)(1) ensures that those terms\nwill be uniformly enforceable nationwide, free from state\ninterference.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  FEHBA “establishes a comprehensive program of health\ninsurance for federal employees.” Empire HealthChoice\nAssurance, Inc. v.

As\njust noted, supra, at 1, FEHBA contains an express-\npreemption provision, §8902(m)(1). FEHBA assigns to\nOPM broad administrative and rulemaking authority over\nthe program. See §§8901–8913. OPM contracts with\nprivate insurance carriers to offer a range of healthcare\nplans. §§8902, 8903.\n  OPM’s contracts with private carriers have long included\n\u000c                     Cite as: 581 U.

Accordingly, OPM has issued detailed\nregulations governing subrogation and reimbursement\nclauses in FEHBA contracts. See 5 CFR §890.106 (2016).\nUnder those regulations, a carrier’s “right to pursue and\nreceive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries consti-\ntutes a condition of and a limitation on the nature of\nbenefits or benefit payments and on the provision of bene-\nfits under the plan’s coverage.” §890.106(b)(1).\n   In 2015, after notice and comment, OPM published a\nrule confirming that “[a] carrier’s rights and responsibili-\nties pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement under\nany [FEHBA] contract relate to the nature, provision, and\nextent of coverage or benefits (including payments with\nrespect to benefits) within the meaning of ” §8902(m)(1).\n§890.106(h). Such “rights and responsibilities,” OPM’s\nrule provides, “are . . . effective notwithstanding any state\nor local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which\nrelates to health insurance or plans.” Ibid. Its rule, OPM\nexplained, “comports with longstanding Federal policy and\nfurthers Congres[s’] goals of reducing health care costs\nand enabling uniform, nationwide application of [FEHBA]\ncontracts.” 80 Fed.

See supra, at 1. The parties agree that Mis-\nsouri’s law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement\nmeets one of the two limitations, i.e., the State’s law “re-\nlates to health insurance or plans.” §8902(m)(1). They\ndispute only whether the subrogation and reimbursement\nrequirements in OPM’s contract with Coventry “relate to\nthe nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits,”\n“including payments with respect to benefits.” Ibid.\n   Coventry contends that §8902(m)(1) unambiguously\ncovers the contractual terms at issue here. In any event,\nCoventry, joined by the United States as amicus curiae,\nurges that the rule published by OPM in 2015 leaves no\nroom for doubt that insurance-contract terms providing for\nsubrogation and reimbursement fall within §8902(m)(1)’s\npreemptive scope. See supra, at 3. Deference is due to\nOPM’s reading, Coventry and the United States assert,\nunder Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

In Nevils’ view, by\ncontrast, §8902(m)(1) does not preempt state antisubroga-\ntion and antireimbursement laws in light of the presump-\ntion against preemption. Given that presumption, Nevils\nmaintains, OPM’s rule is not entitled to deference.\nThough we have called Nevils’ construction “plausible,”\nMcVeigh, 547 U.

Strong and “dis-\ntinctly federal interests are involved,” McVeigh, 547 U.

The Federal Government, more-\nover, has a significant financial stake.

We conclude, however,\nthat the statute, not a contract, strips state law of its\nforce.\n   Without §8902(m)(1), there would be no preemption of\nstate insurance law.

NEVILS\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI\n\n      No. 16–149.      Argued March 1, 2017—Decided April 18, 2017\nThe Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) authoriz-\n  es the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with pri-\n  vate carriers for federal employees’ health insurance. 5 U. S. C.\n  §8902(a), (d). FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision,\n  §8902(m)(1), which states that the “terms of any contract under this\n  chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or\n  benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede\n  and preempt any State or local law . . . which relates to health insur-\n  ance or plans.”\n     OPM’s contracts have long required private carriers to seek subro-\n  gation and reimbursement. Accordingly, OPM’s regulations make a\n  carrier’s “right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement\n  recoveries . . . a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits\n  or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan’s\n  coverage.” 5 CFR §890.106(b)(1). In 2015, OPM published a new rule\n  confirming that a carrier’s subrogation and reimbursement rights\n  and responsibilities “relate to the nature, provision, and extent of\n  coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits)\n  within the meaning of ” §8902(m)(1), and “are . . . effective notwith-\n  standing any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder,\n  which relates to health insurance or plans.” §890.106(h).\n     Respondent Jodie Nevils was insured under a FEHBA plan offered\n  by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri. When Nevils was in-\n  jured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.\n  Coventry subsequently asserted a lien against part of the settlement\n  Nevils recovered from the driver who caused his injuries. Nevils sat-\n  isfied the lien, then filed a class action in Missouri state court, alleg-\n  ing that, under Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or\n\u000c2       COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n reimbursement in this context, Coventry had unlawfully obtained re-\n imbursement. Coventry countered that §8902(m)(1) preempted the\n state law. The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry’s\n favor, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed. The Missouri Su-\n preme Court reversed. Finding §8902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse\n plausible readings, the court invoked a “presumption against\n preemption” to conclude that the federal statute’s preemptive scope\n excluded subrogation and reimbursement. On remand from this\n Court for further consideration in light of OPM’s 2015 rule, the Mis-\n souri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision. A majority of\n the Missouri Supreme Court also held that §8902(m)(1) violates the\n Supremacy Clause.\nHeld:\n    1. Because contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescrip-\n tions plainly “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits,”\n §8902(m)(1), they override state laws barring subrogation and reim-\n bursement. Pp. 6–9.\n       (a) This reading best comports with §8902(m)(1)’s text, context,\n and purpose. Contractual provisions for subrogation and reimburse-\n ment “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits” because subro-\n gation and reimbursement rights yield just such payments. When a\n carrier exercises its right to either reimbursement or subrogation, it\n receives from either the beneficiary or a third party “payment” re-\n specting the benefits the carrier had previously paid. The carrier’s\n very provision of benefits triggers the right to payment. Congress’\n use of the expansive phrase “relate to,” which “express[es] a broad\n pre-emptive purpose,” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504\n U. S. 374, 383, weighs against Nevils’ effort to narrow the term\n “payments” to exclude payments that occur “long after” a carrier’s\n provision of benefits. Nevils’ argument that Congress intended to\n preempt only state coverage requirements, e.g., inclusion of acupunc-\n ture and chiropractic services, also miscarries.\n    The statutory context and purpose reinforce this conclusion.\n FEHBA concerns “benefits from a federal health insurance plan for\n federal employees that arise from a federal law.” Bell v. Blue Cross \u0026\n Blue Shield of Okla., 823 F. 3d 1198, 1202. Strong and “distinctly\n federal interests are involved,” Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc.\n v. McVeigh, 547 U. S. 677, 696, in uniform administration of the pro-\n gram, free from state interference, particularly in regard to coverage,\n benefits, and payments. The Federal Government also has a signifi-\n cant financial stake in subrogation and reimbursement. Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) McVeigh’s suggestion that §8902(m)(1) has two “plausible”\n interpretations, 547 U. S., at 698, Nevils asserts, supports applica-\n tion of the presumption against preemption here. But the Court nev-\n\u000c                      Cite as: 581 U.

Pp. 8–9.\n     2. The regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy\n  Clause. The statute itself, not a contract, strips state law of its force.\n  FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only if they fall within\n  §8902(m)(1)’s preemptive scope. Many other federal statutes found to\n  preempt state law, including the Employee Retirement Income Secu-\n  rity Act of 1974 and the Federal Arbitration Act, leave the context-\n  specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.                 While\n  §8902(m)(1)’s phrasing may differ from those other statutes’,\n  FEHBA’s express-preemption provision manifests the same intent to\n  preempt state law. Pp. 9–11.\n492 S.

S. C. §8901 et seq., Congress authorized the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with\nprivate carriers for federal employees’ health insurance.\n§8902(a), (d). FEHBA contains a provision expressly\npreempting state law. §8902(m)(1). That provision reads:\n    “The terms of any contract under this chapter which\n    relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or\n    benefits (including payments with respect to benefits)\n    shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or\n    any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to\n    health insurance or plans.”\nContracts OPM negotiates with private carriers provide\nfor reimbursement and subrogation.         Reimbursement\nrequires an insured employee who receives payment from\nanother source (e.g., the proceeds yielded by a tort claim)\nto return healthcare costs earlier paid out by the carrier.\nSubrogation involves transfer of the right to a third-party\npayment from the insured employee to the carrier, who\n\u000c2     COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncan then pursue the claim against the third party. Several\nStates, however, Missouri among them, bar enforcement of\ncontractual subrogation and reimbursement provisions.\n   The questions here presented: Does FEHBA’s express-\npreemption prescription, §8902(m)(1), override state law\nprohibiting subrogation and reimbursement; and if\n§8902(m)(1) has that effect, is the statutory prescription\nconsistent with the Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art.\nVI, cl. 2? We hold, contrary to the decision of the Missouri\nSupreme Court, that contractual subrogation and reim-\nbursement prescriptions plainly “relate to . . . payments\nwith respect to benefits,” §8902(m)(1); therefore, by statu-\ntory instruction, they override state law barring subroga-\ntion and reimbursement. We further hold, again contrary\nto the Missouri Supreme Court, that the regime Congress\nenacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause. Section\n8902(m)(1) itself, not the contracts OPM negotiates, trig-\ngers the federal preemption. As Congress directed, where\nFEHBA contract terms “relate to the nature, provision, or\nextent of coverage or benefits (including payments with\nrespect to benefits),” §8902(m)(1) ensures that those terms\nwill be uniformly enforceable nationwide, free from state\ninterference.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  FEHBA “establishes a comprehensive program of health\ninsurance for federal employees.” Empire HealthChoice\nAssurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U. S. 677, 682 (2006). As\njust noted, supra, at 1, FEHBA contains an express-\npreemption provision, §8902(m)(1). FEHBA assigns to\nOPM broad administrative and rulemaking authority over\nthe program. See §§8901–8913. OPM contracts with\nprivate insurance carriers to offer a range of healthcare\nplans. §§8902, 8903.\n  OPM’s contracts with private carriers have long included\n\u000c                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions requiring those carriers to seek subrogation and\nreimbursement. Accordingly, OPM has issued detailed\nregulations governing subrogation and reimbursement\nclauses in FEHBA contracts. See 5 CFR §890.106 (2016).\nUnder those regulations, a carrier’s “right to pursue and\nreceive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries consti-\ntutes a condition of and a limitation on the nature of\nbenefits or benefit payments and on the provision of bene-\nfits under the plan’s coverage.” §890.106(b)(1).\n   In 2015, after notice and comment, OPM published a\nrule confirming that “[a] carrier’s rights and responsibili-\nties pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement under\nany [FEHBA] contract relate to the nature, provision, and\nextent of coverage or benefits (including payments with\nrespect to benefits) within the meaning of ” §8902(m)(1).\n§890.106(h). Such “rights and responsibilities,” OPM’s\nrule provides, “are . . . effective notwithstanding any state\nor local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which\nrelates to health insurance or plans.” Ibid. Its rule, OPM\nexplained, “comports with longstanding Federal policy and\nfurthers Congres[s’] goals of reducing health care costs\nand enabling uniform, nationwide application of [FEHBA]\ncontracts.” 80 Fed. Reg. 29203 (2015) (final rule).\n                            B\n  Respondent Jodie Nevils is a former federal employee\nwho enrolled in and was insured under a FEHBA plan\noffered by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri.1\nNevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 418 S. W. 3d 451, 453\n(Mo. 2014) (Nevils I ). When Nevils was injured in an\nautomobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.\nIbid.

NEVILS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith OPM, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a–130a, Coventry\nasserted a lien for $6,592.24 against part of the settlement\nproceeds to cover medical bills it had paid. Nevils I, 418\nS. W. 3d, at 453. Nevils repaid that amount, thereby\nsatisfying the lien. Ibid.\n  Nevils then filed this class action against Coventry in\nMissouri state court, alleging that Coventry had unlawfully\nobtained reimbursement. Ibid. Nevils premised his claim\non Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or\nreimbursement in this context, see, e.g., Benton House,\nLLC v. Cook \u0026 Younts Ins., Inc., 249 S. W. 3d 878, 881–\n882 (Mo. App. 2008). Coventry countered that §8902(m)(1)\nmakes subrogation and reimbursement clauses in FEHBA\ncontracts enforceable notwithstanding state law. The trial\ncourt granted summary judgment in Coventry’s favor,\nNevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., No. 11SL–CC00535\n(Cir. Ct., St. Louis Cty., Mo., May 21, 2012), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 28a, 32a, and the Missouri Court of Appeals\naffirmed, Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 2012 WL\n6689542, *5 (Dec. 26, 2012).\n  The Missouri Supreme Court reversed. Nevils I, 418\nS. W. 3d, at 457. That court began with “the assumption\nthat the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be\nsuperseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear\nand manifest purpose of Congress.” Id., at 454 (quoting\nCipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 516 (1992))\n(alterations in original). Finding §8902(m)(1) susceptible\nto diverse “plausible readings,” the court invoked a “pre-\nsumption against preemption” to conclude that the federal\nstatute’s preemptive scope excluded subrogation and\nreimbursement. 418 S. W. 3d, at 455.\n  Judge Wilson, joined by Judge Breckenridge, concurred\nin the judgment. Id., at 457. Observing that “it defies\nlogic to insist that benefit repayment terms do not relate\nto the nature or extent of Nevils’ benefits,” id., at 460\n(emphasis deleted), Judge Wilson concluded that “Con-\n\u000c                    Cite as: 581 U.

He nevertheless concurred, reasoning that the Su-\npremacy Clause did not authorize preemption based on\nthe terms of FEHBA contracts. Id., at 462–465.\n   Coventry sought our review, and we invited the Solicitor\nGeneral to file a brief expressing the views of the United\nStates. Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 574\nU.

This Court granted certiorari,\nvacated the Missouri Supreme Court’s judgment, and\nremanded for further consideration in light of OPM’s\nrecently adopted rule. Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v.\nNevils, 576 U. S. ___ (2015).\n   On remand, the Missouri Supreme Court adhered to its\nearlier decision. Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 492\nS. W. 3d 918, 920, 925 (2016). OPM’s rule, the court main-\ntained, “does not overcome the presumption against\npreemption and demonstrate Congress’ clear and manifest\nintent to preempt state law.” Id., at 920.\n   Judge Wilson again concurred, this time joined by a\nmajority of the judges of the Missouri Supreme Court. Id.,\nat 925.2 In their view, Congress’ “attempt to give preemp-\ntive effect to the provisions of a contract between the\nfederal government and a private party is not a valid\napplication of the Supremacy Clause” and, “therefore, does\nnot displace Missouri law here.” Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve conflicting interpreta-\ntions of §8902(m)(1). 580 U.

See supra, at 1. The parties agree that Mis-\nsouri’s law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement\nmeets one of the two limitations, i.e., the State’s law “re-\nlates to health insurance or plans.” §8902(m)(1). They\ndispute only whether the subrogation and reimbursement\nrequirements in OPM’s contract with Coventry “relate to\nthe nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits,”\n“including payments with respect to benefits.” Ibid.\n   Coventry contends that §8902(m)(1) unambiguously\ncovers the contractual terms at issue here. In any event,\nCoventry, joined by the United States as amicus curiae,\nurges that the rule published by OPM in 2015 leaves no\nroom for doubt that insurance-contract terms providing for\nsubrogation and reimbursement fall within §8902(m)(1)’s\npreemptive scope. See supra, at 3. Deference is due to\nOPM’s reading, Coventry and the United States assert,\nunder Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). In Nevils’ view, by\ncontrast, §8902(m)(1) does not preempt state antisubroga-\ntion and antireimbursement laws in light of the presump-\ntion against preemption. Given that presumption, Nevils\nmaintains, OPM’s rule is not entitled to deference.\nThough we have called Nevils’ construction “plausible,”\nMcVeigh, 547 U. S., at 698, the reading advanced by Cov-\nentry and the United States best comports with\n§8902(m)(1)’s text, context, and purpose.\n                           A\n Contractual provisions for subrogation and reimburse-\nment “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits”\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause subrogation and reimbursement rights yield just\nsuch payments. When a carrier exercises its right to\neither reimbursement or subrogation, it receives from\neither the beneficiary or a third party “payment” respect-\ning the benefits the carrier had previously paid. The\ncarrier’s very provision of benefits triggers the right to\npayment. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; Helfrich, 804 F. 3d, at\n1106; Bell, 823 F. 3d, at 1204.\n   Congress’ use of the expansive phrase “relate to” shores\nup that understanding. We have “repeatedly recognized”\nthat the phrase “relate to” in a preemption clause “ex-\npress[es] a broad pre-emptive purpose.” Morales v. Trans\nWorld Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383 (1992); accord\nNorthwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2014)\n(slip op., at 5, 9). Congress characteristically employs the\nphrase to reach any subject that has “a connection with, or\nreference to,” the topics the statute enumerates. Morales,\n504 U. S., at 384. The phrase therefore weighs against\nNevils’ effort to narrow the term “payments” to exclude\npayments that occur “long after” a carrier’s provision of\nbenefits (Brief for Respondent 27 (quoting McVeigh, 547\nU. S., at 697)). See Nevils I, 418 S. W. 3d, at 460 (Wilson,\nJ., concurring); cf. Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 10) (in the Federal Employees’ Group\nLife Insurance Act context, it “makes no difference”\nwhether state law withholds benefits in the first instance\nor instead takes them away after they have been paid).\nGiven language notably “expansive [in] sweep,” Morales,\n504 U. S., at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nNevils’ argument that Congress intended to preempt only\nstate coverage requirements (e.g., for acupuncture and\nchiropractic services, see Brief for Respondent 36) also\nmiscarries.\n   The statutory context and purpose reinforce our conclu-\nsion. FEHBA concerns “benefits from a federal health\ninsurance plan for federal employees that arise from a\n\u000c8      COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal law” in an area with a “long history of federal\ninvolvement.” Bell, 823 F. 3d, at 1202. Strong and “dis-\ntinctly federal interests are involved,” McVeigh, 547 U. S.,\nat 696, in uniform administration of the program, free\nfrom state interference, particularly in regard to coverage,\nbenefits, and payments. The Federal Government, more-\nover, has a significant financial stake. OPM estimates\nthat, in 2014 alone, FEHBA “carriers were reimbursed by\napproximately $126 million in subrogation recoveries.” 80\nFed. Reg. 29203. Such “recoveries translate to premium\ncost savings for the federal government and [FEHBA]\nenrollees.” Ibid.\n                              B\n  Invoking our suggestion in McVeigh that §8902(m)(1)\nhas two “plausible” interpretations, 547 U. S., at 698,\nNevils nonetheless urges us to apply a presumption\nagainst preemption because §8902(m)(1) does not clearly\ncover contractual terms pertaining to subrogation and\nreimbursement. This argument is blind to McVeigh’s\ncontext.\n  In McVeigh, we considered the discrete question whether\n28 U. S. C. §1331 gives federal courts subject-matter\njurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions. See 547\nU. S., at 683. Our principal holding was that §1331 did\nnot confer federal jurisdiction. Ibid.; see Bell, 823 F. 3d, at\n1205.\n  The carrier in McVeigh, as part of its argument in favor\nof federal jurisdiction, asserted that §8902(m)(1) itself\nconferred federal jurisdiction. See 547 U. S., at 697. In\nresponding to that assertion, we summarized competing\ninterpretations of §8902(m)(1) advanced in briefing, read-\nings that map closely onto the parties’ positions here. See\nibid. (carrier and United States as amicus curiae urged\ninterpretation similar to Coventry’s; an amicus brief in\nsupport of beneficiary offered interpretation similar to\n\u000c                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nNevils’).\n  We made no choice between the two interpretations\nset out in McVeigh, however, because the answer made\nno difference to the question there presented. Id., at\n698. “[E]ven if FEHBA’s preemption provision reaches\ncontract-based reimbursement claims,” we explained, “that\nprovision is not sufficiently broad to confer federal juris-\ndiction.” Ibid. Because §8902(m)(1) is a “choice-of-law\nprescription,” not a “jurisdiction-conferring provision,” id.,\nat 697, we had no cause to consider §8902(m)(1)’s text,\ncontext, and purpose, as we do today, see supra, at 6–8.3\n                             III\n   Nevils further contends that, if §8902(m)(1) covers\nsubrogation and reimbursement clauses in OPM contracts,\nthen the statute itself would violate the Supremacy Clause\nby assigning preemptive effect to the terms of a contract,\nnot to the laws of the United States. We conclude, however,\nthat the statute, not a contract, strips state law of its\nforce.\n   Without §8902(m)(1), there would be no preemption of\nstate insurance law. FEHBA contract terms have preemp-\ntive force only as they “relate to the nature, provision, or\nextent of coverage or benefits (including payments with\nrespect to benefits),” §8902(m)(1)—i.e., when the contract\nterms fall within the statute’s preemptive scope. It is\ntherefore the statute that “ensures that [FEHBA contract]\nterms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, notwith-\nstanding any state law relating to health insurance or\nplans.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   Many other federal statutes preempt state law in this\nway, leaving the context-specific scope of preemption to\n\n——————\n 3 Because the statute alone resolves this dispute, we need not consider\n\nwhether Chevron deference attaches to OPM’s 2015 rule.\n\u000c10      COVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MO., INC. v. NEVILS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncontractual terms. The Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq., for\nexample, preempts “any and all State laws insofar as\nthey . . . relate to any employee benefit plan.” §1144(a).\nAnd the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1\net seq., limits the grounds for denying enforcement of\n“written provision[s] in . . . contract[s]” providing for arbi-\ntration, thereby preempting state laws that would other-\nwise interfere with such contracts. §2. This Court has\nseveral times held that those statutes preempt state law,\nsee, e.g., Gobeille v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 577 U. S. ___,\n___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 5–12) (ERISA); Marmet Health\nCare Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U. S. 530, 532–534 (2012)\n(per curiam) (FAA), and Nevils does not contend that\nthose measures violate the Supremacy Clause, see Brief\nfor Respondent 22.\n   Nevils instead attempts to distinguish those other stat-\nutes by highlighting a particular textual feature of\n§8902(m)(1): Section 8902(m)(1) states that the “terms of\nany contract” between OPM and a carrier “shall supersede\nand preempt” certain state or local laws. (Emphasis added.)\nThat formulation, Nevils asserts, violates the Supremacy\nClause’s mandate that only the “Laws of the United\nStates” may reign supreme over state law. U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2 (emphasis added). Nevils’ argument elevates\nsemantics over substance. While Congress’ formulation\nmight differ from the phrasing of other statutes,\n§8902(m)(1) manifests the same intent to preempt state\nlaw.4 Because we do not require Congress to employ a\n——————\n  4 Congress’ choice of language is not unique to §8902(m)(1). Several\n\nrelated statutes governing federal-employee and military-member\nbenefits employ similar formulations. See §8959 (“The terms of any\ncontract that relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or\nbenefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede\nand preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereun-\nder, which relates to dental benefits, insurance, plans, or contracts.”);\n\u000c                     Cite as: 581 U.

S. C.\n§1103(a) (certain state laws “shall not apply to any contract entered\ninto pursuant to this chapter”).\n  5 Nevils’ speculation about the Government’s outsourcing preemption\n\nto private entities, see Brief for Respondent 24, is far afield from the\nmatter before us. This case involves only Congress’ preemption of state\ninsurance laws to ensure that the terms in contracts negotiated by\nOPM, a federal agency, operate free from state interference.\n\u000c                 Cite as: 581 U.

A\nstatute that confers on an executive agency the power to\nenter into contracts that pre-empt state law—such as the\nFederal Employee Health Benefits Act of 1959, 5 U. S. C.\n§8902—might unlawfully delegate legislative power to the\nPresident insofar as the statute fails sufficiently to con-\nstrain the President’s contracting discretion. See Depart-\nment of Transportation v. Association of American Rail-\nroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 11–22); see also\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n472 (2001). Respondent, however, failed to make that\nargument. The Court therefore appropriately leaves that\nissue to be decided, if at all, on remand.\n\u000c",
