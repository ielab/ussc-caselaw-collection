The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would\ngrant the application for stay of execution and the petition\nfor a writ of certiorari.\n   JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE KAGAN would grant the\napplication for stay of execution.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of applica-\ntion for stay and denial of certiorari.\n   After a four-day evidentiary hearing at which seventeen\nwitnesses testified and volumes of evidence were intro-\nduced, the District Court issued an exhaustive 101-page\nopinion enjoining petitioners’ executions. The court found\nthat Arkansas’ current lethal-injection protocol posed a\nsubstantial risk of severe pain and that petitioners had\nidentified available alternative methods of execution. The\nEighth Circuit reversed these findings in a six-page opin-\nion.\n   As Judge Kelly noted persuasively in dissent, the Eighth\nCircuit erred at both steps of the analysis required by\nGlossip v.

See id., at ___ (slip op., at 16)\n(a district court’s findings of fact regarding risk of pain are\n“review[ed] . . . under the deferential ‘clear error’ stand-\nard”). The Court of Appeals thus erroneously swept aside\nthe District Court’s well-supported finding that midazolam\ncreates a substantial risk of severe pain. Second, it im-\nposed a restrictive view of what qualifies as an “available”\nalternative under Glossip.\n  I continue to harbor significant doubts about the wisdom\nof imposing the perverse requirement that inmates offer\nalternative methods for their own executions.
